# Scenarios

## failing_api_alert_cross_namespace

Alert fires for 100% payment error rate (payments-api returns
503).
RCA: reporting-service in shared-services leaks database connections,
exhausting the shared PostgreSQL pool; payments-api in payments cannot
acquire a connection.
Expected: identify shared-services/reporting-service as the root cause;
shared-services/reconciliation-service CrashLooping is a separate issue,
not the cause.

**Tags**: `difficulty_hard`, `classic`, `core`, `alert`

### Query

```
The payment service in the payments namespace is failing customer requests. Can you investigate the cause and check its dependencies in other namespaces?
```

### openai-gpt-5-4 (run 1/10)

**Correctness**: ✅ PASS (score: 0.98)

> Custom answer correctness: 0.98 - The response is essentially correct and closely matches the expected answer.

**Duration**: 45s

**Tokens**: in 241,248 out 526

````markdown
Findings:

- `payments/payments-api` pod is healthy, but every request returns `503`.
- Root cause is **PostgreSQL connection exhaustion** in `shared-services`.

Evidence:

- `payments-api` logs:
  - `connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" ... failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- Active alerts:
  - `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments`
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` / `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` in `shared-services`

Dependency check across namespaces:

1. `shared-services/postgres`
   - Running, but rejecting new app connections.
   - Postgres logs show repeated `remaining connection slots are reserved...`

2. `shared-services/reporting-service`
   - Running, but appears to be the **connection leak source**.
   - Logs repeat every 10s:
     - `Open db connection`
     - `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
   - DB inspection shows:
     - `dbuser | 10.128.2.248 | idle in transaction | 16`
   - `10.128.2.248` is the IP of `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg`

3. `shared-services/reconciliation-service`
   - `CrashLoopBackOff`
   - Misconfigured probes: checking `HTTP` on port `8443`, returning `400`/connection refused
   - This is a separate issue. I found no evidence it is causing payment failures.

Conclusion:

- **Cause of payment failures:** `reporting-service` in `shared-services` is leaking DB connections after a `division by zero` error, exhausting PostgreSQL connection slots.
- **Direct dependency failing:** `shared-services/postgres`
- **Likely upstream offender:** `shared-services/reporting-service`
- **Other dependency issue:** `shared-services/reconciliation-service` is broken, but not the cause of the payment outage.

Recommended fix:

1. Fix `reporting-service` error handling / close DB connections on failure.
2. Short-term recovery:
   - restart `reporting-service` and/or `postgres` to free stuck sessions
3. Fix `reconciliation-service` probe config:
   - probe protocol/port do not match the container behavior

If you want, I can take the next step and:
- restart the leaking `reporting-service`,
- restart `postgres`,
- or inspect the deployments to propose the exact config/code fix.

### openai-gpt-5-4 (run 2/10)

**Correctness**: ✅ PASS (score: 0.98)

> Custom answer correctness: 0.98 - The response is almost fully correct and aligns very closely with the expected answer.

**Duration**: 53s

**Tokens**: in 238,462 out 768

````markdown
I investigated it.

**Cause**
- `payments/payments-api` is **running**, but customer requests fail with **503**.
- App logs show the failure is **database connection exhaustion** to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`:
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- Active alert confirms impact:
  - `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments`
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` and `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` in `shared-services`

**Evidence**
- `payments-api` logs: every `/api/v1/process-payment` request fails on PostgreSQL connect, returns 503.
- PostgreSQL metrics:
  - `max_connections = 20`
  - `superuser_reserved_connections = 3`
  - current sessions include:
    - `demo` user: `2 active`
    - `dbuser`: `16 idle in transaction`
- PostgreSQL logs show repeated connection-slot exhaustion.

**Dependency check in other namespaces**
`payments-api` has one clear cross-namespace dependency:
- `PGHOST=postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`

I checked `shared-services`:

1. **postgres**
   - Pod is **Running**
   - Service is reachable
   - But it is **saturated** on connections

2. **reporting-service**
   - Pod is **Running**
   - Logs repeatedly show:
     - `Open db connection`
     - then `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
   - This strongly suggests it is **opening DB connections and not cleaning them up**, causing the `16 idle in transaction` sessions and exhausting PostgreSQL.

3. **reconciliation-service**
   - Pod is **CrashLoopBackOff**
   - Misconfigured probes:
     - probes hit `HTTP` on port `8443`
     - container returns `400` / probe failures
   - This is a separate dependency issue in `shared-services`, but it does **not** appear to be the direct cause of payment request failures.

**Most likely root cause**
- `shared-services/reporting-service` is leaking or holding PostgreSQL sessions open after its `division by zero` failures.
- That fills PostgreSQL connection slots.
- `payments-api` then cannot get DB connections, so all payment requests fail.

**Recommended fix**
1. **Fix or stop `reporting-service` first**
   - resolve the `division by zero` bug
   - ensure DB connections/transactions are closed on error
   - immediate mitigation: scale it down temporarily
2. **Clear stuck DB sessions**
   - restart PostgreSQL **or** terminate leaked sessions if you want less disruption
3. **Then re-test `payments-api`**
   - payment errors should stop once DB capacity is available
4. **Also fix `reconciliation-service` probes**
   - likely wrong scheme/port combination

**Summary**
- `payments-api` itself is healthy.
- The outage is caused by a **shared PostgreSQL dependency in `shared-services`**.
- The **likely offender is `reporting-service`**, which is generating errors and leaving many sessions `idle in transaction`.

For troubleshooting, this follows the standard OpenShift approach of checking pod events and logs first: *Support - OpenShift Container Platform 4.22* (`https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/support/index_chunk_251`).

If you want, I can take the next step and identify the safest immediate recovery action, for example:
- scale down `reporting-service`, or
- restart PostgreSQL, or
- both in the least disruptive order.

### openai-gpt-5-4 (run 3/10)

**Correctness**: ✅ PASS (score: 0.99)

> Custom answer correctness: 0.99 - The response is essentially correct and closely matches the expected answer.

**Duration**: 56s

**Tokens**: in 229,860 out 757

````markdown
I found the cause.

**Root cause**
- `payments/payments-api` is healthy as a pod, but **every request fails with 503**.
- Its logs show DB connection failures to **`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`**:
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- There is also an active alert:
  - `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments`
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` in `shared-services`

**Why the DB is saturated**
- In `shared-services`, Postgres is up:
  - pod: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-7vlxk` `2/2 Running`
- But `pg_stat_activity` shows many leaked sessions:
  - **16 connections** from client `10.128.2.248`
  - all `idle in transaction`
  - query: `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`
- `10.128.2.248` is pod:
  - `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg`

**Dependency findings in other namespaces**
1. **Primary dependency: Postgres in `shared-services`**
   - reachable, running
   - **not usable** because connection slots are exhausted

2. **Source of exhaustion: `reporting-service` in `shared-services`**
   - logs every 10s:
     - `Open db connection`
     - `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
   - This strongly indicates it opens a DB transaction, errors, and leaves the session open.
   - Deployment is on **image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`**

3. **Other shared dependency issue**
   - `reconciliation-service` is **CrashLoopBackOff**
   - Misconfigured probes:
     - container exposes `8080`
     - probes hit `HTTP :8443 /`
   - This is a real issue, but **not the cause** of the payment failures.

**Payment service status**
- `payments-api` deployment: `1/1 Available`
- No pod restarts
- No warning events in `payments`
- Dependency config points only to Postgres:
  - `PGHOST=postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`

**Conclusion**
- **Customer payment failures are caused by Postgres connection exhaustion.**
- **The likely offender is `shared-services/reporting-service` leaking idle transactions after a `division by zero` error.**
- `reconciliation-service` is also broken, but separately.

**Recommended immediate fix**
1. Stop the leak:
   - scale `reporting-service` to 0 or roll back/fix `v1.0.2`
2. Clear exhausted DB sessions:
   - restart Postgres **or** terminate leaked sessions
3. Then verify `payments-api` requests recover

**Recommended permanent fix**
- In `reporting-service`:
  - close connections on exceptions
  - rollback failed transactions
  - use pooling / connection limits
- Optionally raise `max_connections`, but that is **not** the real fix.

Per OpenShift troubleshooting guidance, checking **events** and **pod logs** is the right first path here: *Support - OpenShift Container Platform 4.22*, https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/support/index_chunk_251

If you want, I can take the next step and either:
- scale down `reporting-service`, or
- inspect/terminate the leaked Postgres sessions safely.

### openai-gpt-5-4 (run 4/10)

**Correctness**: ✅ PASS (score: 0.99)

> Custom answer correctness: 0.99 - The response is essentially correct and closely matches the expected answer.

**Duration**: 54s

**Tokens**: in 229,649 out 531

````markdown
I investigated it.

**Root cause**
- `payments/payments-api` is **Running/Ready**, but requests fail because its DB dependency is exhausted.
- App logs show repeated:
  - `503`
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- `payments-api` connects to:
  - `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`

**Why the DB is exhausted**
- Active alerts in `shared-services`:
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (**critical**)
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` (**warning**)
- On the PostgreSQL pod, current sessions show:
  - **16 connections** from `10.128.2.248`
  - state: **`idle in transaction`**
  - query: **`SELECT count(*) FROM reports`**
- `10.128.2.248` is the pod IP of:
  - `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg`

**Likely cause in dependency**
- `reporting-service` logs repeat every 10s:
  - `Open db connection`
  - `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
- This strongly indicates **reporting-service is leaking DB connections/transactions** when it errors, eventually exhausting PostgreSQL and causing payment failures.

**Other cross-namespace dependency findings**
- `shared-services/postgres`: **Running**
- `shared-services/reporting-service`: **Running**, but likely the source of the DB leak
- `shared-services/reconciliation-service`: **CrashLoopBackOff**
  - probes hit **port 8443**
  - container exposes **8080**
  - this is a real issue, but it does **not** appear to be the direct cause of payment request failures

**Conclusion**
- **Primary cause of payment failures:** PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`
- **Most likely offender:** `shared-services/reporting-service`
- **Secondary issue:** `shared-services/reconciliation-service` probe misconfiguration

**Recommended immediate fix**
1. Restart or scale down `reporting-service` to release leaked DB sessions.
2. If needed, restart `postgres` only after draining/fixing the client, otherwise the issue will recur.
3. Fix `reporting-service` code/transaction handling around the `division by zero` path.
4. Fix `reconciliation-service` probes to use the correct port.

If you want, I can take the next step and identify the safest remediation action in-cluster.

### openai-gpt-5-4 (run 5/10)

**Correctness**: ✅ PASS (score: 0.97)

> Custom answer correctness: 0.97 - The response is essentially correct and closely aligned with the expected answer.

**Duration**: 48s

**Tokens**: in 207,289 out 571

````markdown
Findings:

- **Root cause:** `payments/payments-api` is healthy at pod level, but every request fails with **503** because it cannot open DB connections to `shared-services/postgres`.
- **Evidence:** `payments-api` logs repeatedly show:
  - `connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local"... failed`
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- **Alert correlation:** Active alerts:
  - `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments`
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` and `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` in `shared-services`

Dependency check in other namespaces:

1. **shared-services/postgres**
   - Pod: `Running`
   - Service reachable by name/IP
   - But DB is **saturated on connections**
   - Postgres logs confirm repeated `remaining connection slots are reserved...`

2. **shared-services/reporting-service**
   - Pod: `Running`
   - Logs show a likely **connection leak / bad error handling**:
     - repeats `Open db connection`
     - then `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
   - After that, it starts hitting the same Postgres connection-limit errors.
   - This is the strongest suspect for exhausting DB connections.

3. **shared-services/reconciliation-service**
   - Pod: **CrashLoopBackOff**
   - Misconfigured probes:
     - probes hit `HTTP` on port `8443`
     - returning `400` / `connection refused`
   - This is a real issue, but **not the direct cause** of payment request failures.

4. **payments namespace**
   - `payments-api` deployment/service/pod are otherwise healthy:
     - 1/1 ready
     - no restart loop
     - normal scheduling/start events

Conclusion:

- **Customer failures are caused by Postgres connection exhaustion in `shared-services`.**
- **Most likely upstream cause:** `shared-services/reporting-service` repeatedly opens DB connections and errors with `division by zero`, likely leaking or not releasing connections.
- `reconciliation-service` is also broken, but appears **separate**.

Recommended fix order:

1. **Stop the DB pressure**
   - Scale `reporting-service` to 0 or fix/redeploy it.
2. **Restore Postgres capacity**
   - Restart/refresh the offending client or Postgres if connections do not recover.
3. **Fix reporting-service bug**
   - Resolve the `division by zero` path and ensure DB connections are closed on exceptions.
4. **Fix reconciliation-service probes**
   - Probe port/scheme/path do not match the container behavior.

If you want, I can take the next step and identify the fastest safe recovery action in-cluster.

````markdown
Findings:

- Root cause: `payments/payments-api` is healthy, but every request fails on DB connect.
- Evidence from `payments-api` logs:
  - `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
  - returns `503` for `/api/v1/process-payment`

What is broken in other namespaces:

1. `shared-services/postgres`
- Pod is `Running`.
- DB is saturated.
- Live query inside Postgres shows:
  - `max_connections = 20`
  - `16` sessions from client `10.128.2.248`
  - state: `idle in transaction`
  - query: `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`

2. `shared-services/reporting-service`
- Pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg` has IP `10.128.2.248`
- Logs show a loop:
  - `Open db connection`
  - `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
- This is leaking DB connections and exhausting Postgres.

3. `shared-services/reconciliation-service`
- Unhealthy, but separate issue.
- Pod is `CrashLoopBackOff`.
- Probes are misconfigured:
  - container exposes `8080`
  - probes hit `HTTP` on `8443`
  - probe failures: `400` / `connection refused`
- This does not appear to be the cause of payment request failures.

Alerts match this:
- `payments/PaymentErrorRateHigh` critical
- `shared-services/PostgresqlTooManyConnections` critical
- `shared-services/PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` warning
- `shared-services/reconciliation-service` crashloop alerts

Dependency summary:
- `payments` depends on `shared-services/postgres`
- `shared-services/reporting-service` is indirectly impacting `payments` by consuming DB connections
- `shared-services/reconciliation-service` is also broken, but likely unrelated to the current payment outage

Recommended fix:
1. Stop the connection leak from `shared-services/reporting-service`
   - quickest mitigation: restart or scale it to `0`
2. Clear stale DB sessions if needed
3. Then verify `payments-api` recovers

If you want, I can apply the mitigation now by scaling down `reporting-service` and then recheck payment health.

**Duration**: 1m 2s

**Tokens**: in 281,657 out 621

````markdown
I found the cause.

**Root cause**
- `payments/payments-api` is healthy as a pod, but requests fail because it cannot get a PostgreSQL connection.
- `payments-api` logs show repeated:
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
  - responses are `503` on `/api/v1/process-payment`
- `payments-api` depends on `shared-services/postgres` via:
  - `PGHOST=postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
  - `PGUSER=dbuser`

**What is breaking PostgreSQL**
- Active alerts in `shared-services`:
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` **critical**
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` **warning**
- PostgreSQL config/metrics:
  - `max_connections = 20`
  - `superuser_reserved_connections = 3`
  - so only **17 non-superuser slots** are usable
- Current activity:
  - `16` sessions are `idle in transaction` for user `dbuser`
  - `2` more sessions are active for the app workload
- Direct DB inspection shows the leaking client:
  - `client_addr=10.128.2.248`
  - that IP is pod `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg`

**Dependency check across namespaces**
- `payments -> shared-services/postgres` is the critical dependency path.
- `shared-services/reporting-service` is consuming/leaking DB connections and starving `payments`.
- `shared-services/reporting-service` logs show:
  - repeated `Open db connection`
  - repeated `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
  - then later connection failures to postgres
- This strongly indicates `reporting-service` is opening DB connections and not cleaning them up on the error path.

**Other issue found**
- `shared-services/reconciliation-service` is also unhealthy:
  - `CrashLoopBackOff`
  - liveness/readiness probes hit `http://:8443/` and get `400` / connection refused
- This looks separate from the payment outage.

**Conclusion**
- **Customer payment failures are caused by PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services/postgres`.**
- **The immediate upstream cause is `shared-services/reporting-service` leaking DB sessions from pod `10.128.2.248`.**

**Fastest recovery options**
1. Stop or scale down `shared-services/reporting-service` to free DB slots.
2. Restart `shared-services/postgres` only if connections do not clear and you accept DB interruption.
3. Fix `reporting-service` to close/rollback DB connections on exceptions.
4. Longer term:
   - add connection pooling
   - lower idle transaction lifetime
   - raise `max_connections` only if justified

If you want, I can take the next step and **scale down `reporting-service`** or inspect a safe remediation path first.

Cause found.

- `payments/payments-api` pod is healthy, but requests fail with `503`.
- Its logs show DB connection failures to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`:
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

Dependency check across namespaces:

- Direct dependency: `shared-services/postgres`
  - Pod is `Running`, but DB is saturated.
  - Active alerts confirm it:
    - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (`critical`)
    - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` (`warning`)

- Likely source of saturation: `shared-services/reporting-service`
  - Pod is `Running`
  - Logs show every 10s:
    - `Open db connection`
    - then `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
  - Postgres session table shows `16` connections from `10.128.2.248`, which is the `reporting-service` pod, in `idle in transaction`
  - That strongly indicates a connection leak / unclosed transaction in `reporting-service`

- Other dependency issue in `shared-services`:
  - `reconciliation-service` is `CrashLoopBackOff`
  - Bad probe config:
    - container exposes `8080`
    - probes check `http://:8443/`
    - events show probe failures (`400` / connection refused)
  - This is a real issue, but it does not appear to be the cause of payment failures

Bottom line:

- Payment failures are caused by PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services/postgres`
- Most likely root cause is `shared-services/reporting-service` leaking DB connections after its `division by zero` error
- `reconciliation-service` is also broken, but separately

Recommended fix:

1. Stop or scale down `shared-services/reporting-service` to stop leaking connections
2. Fix the app bug in reporting-service so failed jobs close/rollback DB sessions
3. If connections do not clear quickly, restart `shared-services/postgres` after reducing load
4. Fix `reconciliation-service` probe/port mismatch (`8080` vs `8443`)

If you want, I can now:
- verify recovery after `reporting-service` is stopped, or
- make a safe remediation change for you.

Findings:

- **Primary cause:** `payments/payments-api` is healthy but every request fails on **PostgreSQL connection exhaustion**.
- **Evidence:**
  - `payments-api` logs: `503` on `/api/v1/process-payment`
  - Error: `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
  - Alert firing: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments`
  - Alert firing in dependency namespace: `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` / `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` in `shared-services`

Dependency check across namespaces:

1. **shared-services/postgres**
   - Pod is **Running**
   - Service is present and reachable by name
   - DB is configured with **`max_connections = 20`**
   - Current activity shows:
     - **16 connections** from client IP `10.128.2.248`
     - state: **`idle in transaction`**

2. **shared-services/reporting-service**
   - Pod IP `10.128.2.248` matches the DB client holding those 16 connections
   - Logs show repeating pattern:
     - `Open db connection`
     - `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
   - This strongly indicates **reporting-service is leaking DB connections** after exceptions, exhausting Postgres slots.

3. **shared-services/reconciliation-service**
   - **CrashLoopBackOff**
   - Liveness/readiness probes are wrong/broken (`HTTP 400` / connection refused on `:8443`)
   - This is a separate dependency issue, but **not the cause** of payment request failures.

4. **payments namespace**
   - `payments-api` pod is **Running**
   - No warning events in `payments`
   - No NetworkPolicies found blocking traffic

Conclusion:

- **Root cause of customer impact:** `shared-services/reporting-service` is leaking PostgreSQL connections, exhausting the small Postgres connection limit, which causes `payments-api` DB connects to fail and return `503`.

Recommended fix:

1. **Immediate mitigation**
   - Restart or scale down `shared-services/reporting-service` to release leaked sessions.
   - If needed, restart `shared-services/postgres` only if connections do not clear.

2. **Permanent fix**
   - Fix `reporting-service` to close/rollback DB sessions on error paths.
   - Add connection pooling and sane limits.
   - Increase Postgres `max_connections` only as a secondary measure.

3. **Secondary issue**
   - Fix `reconciliation-service` probe/config mismatch.

If you want, I can take the next step and identify the safest immediate remediation in-cluster.

Findings:

- `payments/payments-api` is healthy at the pod/deployment level:
  - Deployment `payments-api`: `1/1` ready
  - Pod `payments-api-559656657c-fqvhw`: `Running`
- Requests fail in-app, not from pod health.

Root cause:

- `payments-api` logs show every failed request returns `503` because PostgreSQL rejects connections:
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- The app is configured to use:
  - `PGHOST=postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
  - DB service in `shared-services`

Dependency check in other namespaces:

1. `shared-services/postgres`
   - Pod is `Running`, service exists at `172.30.91.126:5432`
   - But DB is saturated.
   - `pg_stat_activity` shows:
     - `16` sessions from user `dbuser`
     - all from client `10.128.2.248`
     - state: `idle in transaction`
     - query: `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`

2. Source of the leak: `shared-services/reporting-service`
   - Pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg` has IP `10.128.2.248`
   - Logs show a loop:
     - `Open db connection`
     - `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
   - This strongly indicates it opens DB connections, errors, and leaves them unclosed, exhausting PostgreSQL connections.

3. Other dependency issue in `shared-services`
   - `reconciliation-service` is `CrashLoopBackOff`
   - Probes fail with HTTP `400`
   - This is unhealthy, but I found no evidence it is causing the payment failures.
   - The payment failure is explained by DB connection exhaustion.

Conclusion:

- Cause of customer-facing payment failures: **PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`**
- Most likely trigger: **`shared-services/reporting-service` leaking idle-in-transaction DB sessions after `division by zero` errors**

Recommended immediate actions:

1. Stop the leak:
   - restart or scale down `shared-services/reporting-service`
2. Free DB connections:
   - terminate leaked idle sessions or restart `shared-services/postgres` if acceptable
3. Fix `reporting-service`:
   - ensure DB connections/transactions are closed on exceptions
   - fix the `division by zero` bug

If you want, I can take the next step and identify the safest immediate recovery action in-cluster.

**Duration**: 33s

**Tokens**: in 107,677 out 646

````markdown
## Findings

The payment failures are caused by the PostgreSQL dependency in `shared-services`, not by the `payments-api` pod itself.

### Evidence

- Alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` — **100% error rate** in `payments`.
- `payments-api` is healthy:
  - Deployment: `1/1` ready
  - Pod: Running and Ready
  - Restart count: `0`
- Its logs show repeated HTTP 503 responses because PostgreSQL rejects connections:

```text
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

- PostgreSQL is configured as:

```text
postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432
```

- PostgreSQL pod is running, but the database is connection-exhausted.
- Alerts confirm:
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — **18 active connections**
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh`
- PostgreSQL logs also show invalid connection attempts from other workloads, including roles such as `postgres`, `appuser`, `payments`, and `1001020000`.

## Dependency status

| Dependency | Namespace | Status | Details |
|---|---|---:|---|
| PostgreSQL | `shared-services` | Running | Service and endpoints are present, but connection slots are exhausted |
| Reconciliation service | `shared-services` | **Unhealthy** | Deployment `0/1`; CrashLoopBackOff |
| Reporting service | `shared-services` | Running | Endpoint available on port `8081` |
| `payments-api` | `payments` | Running | Fails requests when connecting to PostgreSQL |

The `reconciliation-service` is also misconfigured: it uses an Apache HTTPD image, exposes port `8080`, but its probes request port `8443` and receive HTTP 400 or connection-refused responses. It has no ready endpoint:

```text
reconciliation-service Endpoints: <none>
```

This is an independent dependency failure, but the immediate cause of payment request failures is PostgreSQL connection exhaustion.

## Recommended remediation

1. Identify and terminate/leak-proof the clients consuming PostgreSQL connections—especially the failing `reconciliation-service` and any incorrectly configured clients.
2. Correct the `reconciliation-service` deployment:
   - Use the intended reconciliation-service image.
   - Align container port, Service port, and readiness/liveness probes.
3. Verify the `payments-db` credentials and ensure all clients use valid database roles.
4. Add connection pooling and per-service connection limits; do not simply increase PostgreSQL `max_connections` without resource sizing.
5. After remediation, verify:
   - PostgreSQL connection count decreases.
   - `reconciliation-service` becomes `1/1` ready.
   - `payments-api` logs stop returning 503.
   - The `PaymentErrorRateHigh` alert clears.

The OpenShift documentation search also recommends checking pod health, logs, service configuration, and network policies when troubleshooting service connectivity; the relevant result was **“Service Mesh - OpenShift Container Platform 4.22”**.

**Duration**: 24s

**Tokens**: in 57,391 out 515

````markdown
## Findings

The payment failures are caused by the PostgreSQL dependency in `shared-services`, not by the payment API pod itself.

- **Alert:** `PaymentErrorRateHigh` is critical; payment error rate is **100%**.
- **Payment API:** `payments/payments-api-559656657c-fqvhw`
  - Running and ready: `1/1`
  - Service endpoints are present on ports `8080` and `8081`
  - Logs show repeated HTTP `503` responses.
- **Database dependency:** `shared-services/postgres`
  - Pod is running and service endpoints are present on port `5432`
  - PostgreSQL logs repeatedly report:

```text
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

The payment API is configured to use:

```text
postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432
database: demo
```

This confirms network/DNS and service routing are functioning; PostgreSQL is reachable but refusing application connections because its connection limit is exhausted.

## Other dependencies

- `shared-services/reconciliation-service`
  - `0/1`, `CrashLoopBackOff`
  - Has no service endpoints.
  - Its liveness/readiness probes return HTTP `400`; it is running an Apache HTTPD image and appears misconfigured for the expected health probes.
- `shared-services/reporting-service`
  - `1/1`, running
  - Service has a healthy endpoint on port `8081`.
- No NetworkPolicies were returned in either namespace, so there is no apparent namespace-isolation issue.

## Recommended remediation

1. Identify and terminate/leak-fix excessive PostgreSQL sessions, preferably using an administrative connection.
2. Inspect active sessions by role and database, especially connections from `payments`, `reconciliation-service`, and `reporting-service`.
3. Configure connection pooling and enforce application connection limits; do not simply increase `max_connections` without checking memory capacity.
4. Fix or remove the broken reconciliation service health probes/image configuration. Its crash loop may be contributing to connection exhaustion.
5. After PostgreSQL connections are released, verify payment API logs and the `PaymentErrorRateHigh` alert.

OpenShift health probes remove pods from service endpoints when readiness fails; this matches the reconciliation service having no endpoints while the payment API and reporting service remain routed.

## Findings

The payment failure is caused by **PostgreSQL connection exhaustion** in `shared-services`.

- Active alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments`; error rate is **100%**.
- PostgreSQL alert: `PostgresqlTooManyConnections`; **18 active connections**.
- PostgreSQL logs repeatedly show:

  `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

This explains the payment API’s customer-request failures: the API is configured to use:

`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`

and PostgreSQL is rejecting new application connections.

## Dependency status

| Dependency | Namespace | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `postgres` | `shared-services` | Running, Service has endpoint `10.128.2.246:5432`, but connection slots exhausted |
| `reconciliation-service` | `shared-services` | **CrashLoopBackOff**, 0/1 ready; Service has **no endpoints** |
| `reporting-service` | `shared-services` | Running, endpoint `10.128.2.248:8081` |
| `payments-api` | `payments` | Running and ready, endpoints present, but requests fail due to backend dependency exhaustion |

The reconciliation service is independently unhealthy: its HTTP probes receive `400`, and its container is repeatedly restarted. Its current image is `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`, which appears inconsistent with the expected reconciliation application and should be investigated.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Reduce or terminate leaked PostgreSQL connections** after identifying their owners.
2. Review connection-pool settings in `payments-api`, `reconciliation-service`, and `reporting-service`; add pooling limits and timeouts.
3. Fix the reconciliation deployment’s image/probe configuration so it exposes the expected health endpoint.
4. Recheck PostgreSQL connection usage and payment error rate after remediation.

**Duration**: 29s

````markdown
## Findings

**Root cause:** PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`.

- `payments/payments-api` is healthy at the Kubernetes level:
  - Pod: `1/1 Running`
  - Deployment: `1/1 Available`
  - Service: `payments-api` has a valid endpoint.
- Its logs show every customer request failing with:
  ```
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```
  Consequently, the API returns HTTP `503`.
- Alertmanager confirms:
  - `PaymentErrorRateHigh` — **critical**, error rate **100%**
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — **critical**
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` — **warning**

## Dependency check

### `shared-services/postgres`

- Pod: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-7vlxk` — `2/2 Running`
- Service: `postgres` — ClusterIP `172.30.91.126`, port `5432`
- PostgreSQL configuration:
  - `max_connections`: **20**
  - `superuser_reserved_connections`: **3**
- Current activity includes **16 connections idle in transaction** for database user `dbuser`, leaving no usable slots for the payment service.

This strongly indicates a connection leak or clients failing to close/commit transactions, rather than a Kubernetes networking or pod availability problem.

### Other dependent services

- `shared-services/reporting-service`: `1/1 Running`
  - Currently reports **16 active connections**, likely contributing to exhaustion.
- `shared-services/reconciliation-service`: **CrashLoopBackOff**
  - Deployment has `0/1` available.
  - This is a separate dependency failure and may also be consuming or repeatedly attempting database connections.

OpenShift documentation recommends starting with pod status and logs when diagnosing application failures; the payment and PostgreSQL logs clearly identify the database connection-limit failure. See **“Support - OpenShift Container Platform 4.22”**: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/support/index_chunk_250

## Recommended remediation

1. Inspect and terminate the 16 stuck `idle in transaction` sessions, if safe.
2. Fix the client connection handling—especially `reporting-service` and `reconciliation-service`—to close transactions and return connections to the pool.
3. Review connection-pool limits so aggregate client pools stay below PostgreSQL’s `max_connections`.
4. Investigate the `reconciliation-service` CrashLoopBackOff separately.
5. Increase `max_connections` only after validating memory capacity; it would mask the leak rather than fix it.

I did not restart or delete workloads, so no live remediation was applied.

## Findings

The payment failures are caused by the PostgreSQL dependency in `shared-services`, not by the `payments-api` pod itself.

- **Alert:** `PaymentErrorRateHigh` is critical; payment error rate is **100%**.
- **Payments API:** `payments/payments-api-559656657c-fqvhw` is `Running` and ready.
- **API logs:** Requests return `503` because PostgreSQL rejects connections with:

  ```text
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```

- **Database:** `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-7vlxk` is running and its Service has a ready endpoint, but PostgreSQL is at its connection limit.
- **Alert:** `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` is critical, with **18 active connections**.
- The payments API correctly targets:

  ```text
  postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432
  ```

## Dependency issue also found

`shared-services/reconciliation-service` is unhealthy:

- Pod: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-v7v9z`
- Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`, `0/1` ready
- Service has **no ready endpoints**
- Its deployment runs the generic `httpd-24` image, while probes expect HTTP on port `8443`; probes return `400` or connection refused.
- This is a separate deployment/probe misconfiguration, but it may contribute to database connection pressure if it or its clients repeatedly reconnect.

`reporting-service` is currently running and its deployment has a ready pod.

## Recommended remediation

1. Identify and terminate/recycle the client connections consuming PostgreSQL slots, then verify payment requests recover.
2. Configure connection pooling and bounded pool sizes for `payments-api` and other database clients.
3. Review PostgreSQL `max_connections` and resource sizing; increase it only after confirming memory capacity.
4. Fix `reconciliation-service` by either:
   - deploying the intended reconciliation application, or
   - changing its probes to match the actual HTTP listener and port.
5. Recheck:
   - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections`
   - `PaymentErrorRateHigh`
   - reconciliation-service readiness and endpoints

I did not make changes, since terminating database connections or modifying the deployment could interrupt in-flight transactions.

**Correctness**: ❌ FAIL (score: 0.60)

> Custom answer correctness: 0.60 - The response correctly identifies the immediate technical failure affecting `payments/payments-api`: PostgreSQL in `shared-services` has exhausted available connection slots, causing payment requests to fail with 503s. It also correctly rules out several alternative causes like pod health, service discovery, endpoints, and network policy issues. That aligns with an important part of the expected answer.

**Duration**: 31s

**Tokens**: in 96,523 out 729

````markdown
## Findings

The payment API itself is running and reachable:

- `payments/payments-api` pod: **1/1 Running**, no restarts
- Service `payments-api`: has healthy endpoints on ports `8080` and `8081`
- No NetworkPolicies are present in either `payments` or `shared-services`, so cross-namespace traffic is not being blocked.

The failure is downstream in PostgreSQL:

- Payment logs repeatedly show:
  ```text
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```
- Requests consequently return **HTTP 503**.
- AlertManager confirms:
  - `PaymentErrorRateHigh`: **100%**
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh`: **18 connections**
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections`: **critical**

The payment service connects to:

```text
postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432
```

That Service and its endpoint are healthy:

- Service: `shared-services/postgres`
- Endpoint: `10.128.2.246:5432`
- PostgreSQL pod: **2/2 Running**

Therefore, this is not a DNS, service-routing, pod-readiness, or network-policy problem. PostgreSQL is reachable but has exhausted its connection capacity.

## Dependency status

| Dependency | Namespace | Status | Assessment |
|---|---|---:|---|
| PostgreSQL | `shared-services` | Running, endpoint present | **Root cause: connection slots exhausted** |
| Reporting service | `shared-services` | Running, ready | Likely another PostgreSQL connection consumer |
| Reconciliation service | `shared-services` | CrashLoopBackOff, no endpoints | Independently unhealthy |
| Payment API | `payments` | Running, endpoints present | Healthy process, but all database-backed requests fail |

The reconciliation service is misconfigured:

- It uses `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`, not an application image.
- Its probes target port `8443`, while the container declares port `8080`.
- The probe receives HTTP `400` and the pod repeatedly restarts.
- Its Service currently has **no endpoints**.

This is a separate dependency failure, but it may also be contributing to PostgreSQL connection pressure if it previously opened connections before entering its crash loop.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Immediately reduce PostgreSQL connection pressure**
   - Inspect active sessions by database/user/application.
   - Terminate leaked or idle sessions after confirming ownership.
   - Restart or scale down the offending workload if it is leaking connections.

2. **Fix connection management**
   - Configure bounded connection pools in the payment and reporting services.
   - Set pool idle/max-lifetime limits and ensure connections are closed.
   - Consider PgBouncer or another connection pooler for shared PostgreSQL access.

3. **Fix `shared-services/reconciliation-service`**
   - Deploy the correct reconciliation application image.
   - Correct its readiness/liveness probe port and path.
   - Do not simply increase probe delays; the current image/probe combination is incorrect.

4. **Review PostgreSQL capacity**
   - Check `max_connections` and memory limits before increasing it.
   - Raising the limit alone may cause memory pressure and is not a substitute for fixing connection leaks.

OpenShift’s readiness behavior is consistent with this diagnosis: failed readiness checks remove a pod from Service endpoints, while liveness failures cause restarts. The PostgreSQL Service remains endpoint-ready, but rejects new application connections.

### `shared-services/postgres`

- Pod: `2/2 Running`
- Service: present and resolving at `172.30.91.126:5432`
- Storage provisioning and attachment succeeded.
- The database process is reachable, but refusing normal application connections because its connection slots are full.

### `shared-services/reconciliation-service`

- Pod: `0/1 CrashLoopBackOff`
- Six restarts observed.
- Both readiness and liveness probes fail:
  - HTTP `400` on `/`
  - Intermittent connection refused on port `8443`
- AlertManager reports the deployment has no ready replicas.

This is an unhealthy payment-processor dependency and may also be contributing to database connection pressure. Its logs show Apache serving HTTP on `8443`, while the configured probe behavior is incompatible with the endpoint.

### `shared-services/reporting-service`

- Pod: `1/1 Running`
- Current version appears healthy.
- An older pod was replaced during rollout, but no current failure is evident.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Reduce or terminate leaked/excess PostgreSQL client connections** after identifying the owning users/applications.
2. Fix connection pooling and ensure clients close connections, especially in `payments-api` and `reconciliation-service`.
3. Correct the `reconciliation-service` health probes to target the actual HTTPS endpoint and expected response, or expose a dedicated health endpoint.
4. Increase PostgreSQL `max_connections` only after confirming available memory and correcting the connection leak; increasing it alone may defer rather than solve the problem.
5. Recheck payment error rate and database connection alerts after remediation.

I did not modify workloads or terminate database sessions.

PostgreSQL logs confirm a sustained stream of rejected connections beginning around `10:11` due to exhausted non-superuser connection slots. Alertmanager also reports:

- `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh`: 18 connections
- `PostgresqlTooManyConnections`: critical
- `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping`
- `SharedServicesDeploymentReplicasMismatch`

## Root cause

The immediate customer-impacting cause is **PostgreSQL connection exhaustion**. The unhealthy `reconciliation-service` is a likely contributing factor, potentially creating or retaining connections, but the evidence does not yet prove that it is the sole source.

The reconciliation deployment also has a configuration issue: it runs Apache on HTTPS port `8443`, while its container declares port `8080` and the probes use an HTTP request to `8443`, returning `400` or refusing connections.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Triage PostgreSQL connections** and identify the owning application/user/processes.
2. Stop or correct the `reconciliation-service` connection behavior and fix its probe/port configuration.
3. Ensure the payment API and other clients use bounded connection pools and close connections properly.
4. Avoid simply increasing PostgreSQL `max_connections` until the connection leak or pool sizing issue is understood.
5. After connections recover, verify payment requests and confirm the critical alerts clear.

**Duration**: 24s

**Tokens**: in 55,710 out 506

````markdown
## Cause

The payment API is healthy at the pod level, but every customer request fails because its PostgreSQL dependency has exhausted client connection slots.

Evidence:

- Alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` — **100% error rate** in `payments`.
- `payments-api` pod: `Running`, `1/1`, no restarts.
- Payment logs repeatedly show:
  ```text
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```
- Requests return HTTP `503`.
- PostgreSQL alert in `shared-services`:
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh`
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — 18 active connections

## Dependency check

The payment deployment is configured to use:

```text
postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432
database: demo
```

That dependency is currently reachable and has a valid endpoint:

- Service: `shared-services/postgres`
- Endpoint: `10.128.2.246:5432`
- PostgreSQL pod: `Running`, `2/2`

Therefore, this is **not primarily DNS, Service, pod scheduling, or cross-namespace connectivity failure**. PostgreSQL is accepting the network connection but refusing the application user because the connection limit is exhausted.

Other payment-related dependencies:

- `shared-services/reporting-service`: `1/1 Running`
- `shared-services/reconciliation-service`: **`0/1 CrashLoopBackOff`**
  - Its probes receive HTTP `400` and the container is repeatedly restarted.
  - This is a separate dependency health issue and may contribute to database connection pressure, but it is not the direct error returned by `payments-api`.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Immediately inspect and clear the connection leak/load** in PostgreSQL clients, especially:
   - `payments-api`
   - `reconciliation-service`
   - reporting service
2. Check PostgreSQL active sessions by application/user and terminate stale sessions if appropriate.
3. Fix or configure application connection pooling and ensure connections are closed.
4. Review PostgreSQL `max_connections` only after identifying the source; increasing it alone may exhaust database memory.
5. Investigate the reconciliation deployment’s incorrect health probes. The current Apache-based container returns `400` for `/` and does not listen on the probed `8443` endpoint.

The direct customer-impacting fault is **PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`**.

## Finding

The payment API itself is healthy at the Kubernetes level:

- `payments/payments-api` Deployment: **1/1 available**
- Pod: **Running, Ready, 0 restarts**
- Service `payments-api`: exists and has the expected selector
- No payment-namespace warning events

However, customer requests return **HTTP 503** because the database dependency is refusing connections:

> `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

This is confirmed in both the payment API logs and PostgreSQL logs. The `PaymentErrorRateHigh` alert reports a **100% error rate**.

## Dependency check

### PostgreSQL — `shared-services`

- Service: `shared-services/postgres`
- DNS target: `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
- Cluster IP: `172.30.91.126`
- Port: `5432`
- Endpoints: **present**, targeting pod `postgres-5bd4d575fb-7vlxk`
- PostgreSQL pod: **2/2 Running, 0 restarts**

Therefore, DNS, service routing, and pod availability are working. The failure is **PostgreSQL connection exhaustion**, not a missing or unreachable service.

### Other shared services

There are additional issues in `shared-services`:

- Alert: `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` — 18 connections
- Alert: `PostgresqlTooManyConnections`
- `reconciliation-service` is crash-looping and failing its probes
- Its events show repeated liveness/readiness failures

That service may be contributing to the database connection pressure, although the database logs also show connection attempts using nonexistent roles such as `postgres`, `appuser`, `payments`, and `1001020000`.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Reduce/stop the connection storm** from `reconciliation-service` and any other clients.
2. Inspect and correct database connection pooling and credentials for:
   - `payments-api`
   - `reconciliation-service`
   - `reporting-service`
3. Verify PostgreSQL’s `max_connections` and active sessions. Increase capacity only after identifying the connection leak or excessive pooling.
4. Restart affected application pods only after correcting the cause; restarting PostgreSQL would be disruptive and is not the first recommendation.
5. Fix the `reconciliation-service` probes/configuration, since it is currently unhealthy and may be repeatedly reconnecting.

## Root cause

`payments-api` is healthy but returns **503 for all payment requests** because its PostgreSQL dependency is out of usable connections:

```text
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

The active critical alert confirms a **100% payment error rate**.

## Cross-namespace dependency findings

| Component | Namespace | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| `payments-api` | `payments` | Running, ready | Cannot connect to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`. |
| `postgres` | `shared-services` | Running, ready | Connection capacity exhausted: **18 active connections** alerting critical. |
| `reporting-service` | `shared-services` | Running | **Cause of exhaustion.** It opens a new DB connection every 10 seconds, hits `division by zero`, and leaves transactions open. PostgreSQL shows **16 `idle in transaction` connections** from pod `10.128.2.248`, all running `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`. |
| `reconciliation-service` | `shared-services` | CrashLoopBackOff | Separate issue: its probes use **HTTP** on port **8443**, where the RHEL HTTPD image expects HTTPS; probes receive HTTP 400 and restart it. It is not the direct payment outage cause. |

## Recommended remediation

1. **Immediately recover capacity:** restart `reporting-service` to release its leaked database sessions.
2. **Fix `reporting-service`:**
   - Correct the `division by zero` defect.
   - Always close/rollback DB transactions on errors.
   - Use bounded connection pooling.
   - Configure PostgreSQL `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` as a safety control.
3. **Fix reconciliation probes:** change the probe scheme to `HTTPS` on `8443`, or probe the application’s actual HTTP listener/port.
4. Recheck payment success/error rate after connections are released.

## Root cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion

`payments-api` is healthy but returns **503** for every payment because PostgreSQL rejects new connections:

> `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

- Active alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` at **100%**.
- Dependency: `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432` is reachable and its pod/service endpoint are healthy.
- PostgreSQL `max_connections` is only **20**.
- `reporting-service` in `shared-services` leaked **16 connections**, all `idle in transaction`, from pod `10.128.2.248`.
- The leaked sessions began every 10 seconds after `reporting-service` started and run `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`.

### Why reporting leaks connections
`reporting-service:v1.0.2` repeatedly logs:

```text
Open db connection
Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
```

Its error path is not closing/rolling back the database connection/transaction. It consumed enough of the 20-connection limit to starve `payments-api`.

## Other dependency status

| Dependency | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | Running, but saturated | Immediate cause of payment failures |
| Reporting service | Running, defective | Connection leak triggered by `division by zero` |
| Reconciliation service | **CrashLoopBackOff** | Not on the payment API’s configured dependency path, but unhealthy |
| Reconciliation endpoint | No ready endpoints | Its HTTP probes use `HTTP` on port `8443`, while the httpd container expects TLS there; probes receive HTTP 400 and restart it |

The reconciliation issue is separate from the current payment outage.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Immediately stop the reporting connection leak**: scale down or restart `reporting-service` to release its sessions. This is a mitigation, not the permanent fix.
2. Fix `reporting-service` to handle the division-by-zero condition and always close connections/rollback transactions on failure; use bounded connection pooling.
3. Raise PostgreSQL `max_connections` only after sizing memory and enforcing application pool limits—it should not substitute for fixing the leak.
4. Correct reconciliation probes to match the container’s actual listener/protocol (likely HTTPS on 8443, or change probes to the actual HTTP port).

OpenShift guidance recommends using pod events and logs to diagnose application failures, which exposed both the database saturation and reconciliation probe failures here: *Support - OpenShift Container Platform 4.22* (https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/support/index_chunk_251).

## Cause confirmed

`payments-api` is healthy and has a ready Service endpoint, but every payment returns **503** because PostgreSQL rejects new connections:

> `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

- **Payment error rate:** 100% (`PaymentErrorRateHigh`, critical).
- **Dependency:** `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432` is reachable and healthy, but saturated.
- PostgreSQL `max_connections` is **20**; it currently has **23** sessions including reserved/internal sessions.

## Source of exhaustion

`shared-services/reporting-service` (**v1.0.2**, pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg`) leaks database sessions:

- **16** sessions from `10.128.2.248` are `idle in transaction`.
- They run `SELECT count(*) FROM reports` and remain open for 2–5+ minutes.
- Its logs show a recurring **`division by zero`** error every 10 seconds immediately after opening a DB connection. The failure path evidently does not close or roll back the connection.

## Other dependency issue

`shared-services/reconciliation-service` is independently unhealthy:

- `CrashLoopBackOff`, 6 restarts.
- Its readiness/liveness probes send **HTTP to port 8443**, while the container’s TLS listener expects HTTPS; probes receive HTTP **400**.
- Its Service has **no endpoints**. This is not the direct cause of the payment 503s.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Immediately stop/roll back `reporting-service`** to release leaked sessions (or terminate the idle transactions from PostgreSQL).
2. Fix reporting service’s division-by-zero handling and ensure its DB sessions are always closed/rolled back; use bounded connection pooling.
3. Add PostgreSQL safeguards: `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`, connection-pool limits, and alerts before connection exhaustion.
4. Correct reconciliation probes to use `scheme: HTTPS` on 8443, or probe the actual HTTP listener/port.

OpenShift readiness failures remove a container from Service endpoints, as documented in *Postinstallation configuration - OpenShift Container Platform 4.22* (https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/postinstallation_configuration/index_chunk_497).

**Root cause:** PostgreSQL in `shared-services` has exhausted client connections, causing `payments-api` to return **503** for all requests.

- `payments/payments-api` is healthy (`1/1 Running`) but logs show:
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved...`
- PostgreSQL is healthy but has **18 active connections** (`PostgresqlTooManyConnections` alert).
- Database inspection identifies the source:
  - **16 connections** from `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg` (`10.128.2.248`)
  - User `dbuser`
  - State: **`idle in transaction`**
- `reporting-service` repeatedly logs `Open db connection` followed by `division by zero`; it appears to leak or leave transactions open. This starves `payments-api`, which depends on `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`.

**Other dependency status**
- `shared-services/postgres`: `2/2 Running`, service reachable; capacity is exhausted, not down.
- `shared-services/reconciliation-service`: `CrashLoopBackOff`. Its Deployment probes **HTTP on port 8443**, while the container declares port **8080**. This is a separate misconfiguration and not the direct cause of payment failures.

**Recommended remediation**
1. Stop/restart `reporting-service` to release its 16 leaked connections.
2. Fix reporting code: handle the division-by-zero error, always close connections, and roll back transactions on failures; use a bounded connection pool.
3. Correct reconciliation probes to target its actual serving port/protocol.
4. Consider temporarily raising PostgreSQL `max_connections` only after fixing the leak; otherwise the incident will recur.

## Cause

`payments-api` is healthy and has a ready endpoint, but returns **503** because PostgreSQL is out of non-superuser connection slots.

- Payment logs: `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- Active critical alerts: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (**100%**) and `PostgresqlTooManyConnections`.
- PostgreSQL shows **16 `dbuser` sessions from `10.128.2.248`**, the `reporting-service` pod—all `idle in transaction`.

## Dependency findings

| Dependency | Namespace | State | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | `shared-services` | Running, reachable | Saturated; the direct dependency of payments |
| Reporting service | `shared-services` | Running | **Root source of saturation**. v1.0.2 repeatedly opens DB connections, then fails with `division by zero`, leaving transactions/connections open. It was updated from v1.0.1 shortly before the incident. |
| Reconciliation service | `shared-services` | CrashLoopBackOff | Misconfigured probes: HTTP requests to port `8443`, while the container declares `8080`; it has no endpoints. This is a separate fault, not the observed payment failure. |

## Recommended recovery

1. **Immediately stop or roll back `reporting-service` v1.0.2** to release its leaked PostgreSQL connections. Rollback to the prior v1.0.1 ReplicaSet is the likely lowest-risk recovery.
2. Fix the reporting job’s `division by zero` path and guarantee connections/transactions are closed on failures; use bounded pooling.
3. Correct reconciliation probes to match the application’s actual listener/protocol. Its readiness failure appropriately removes it from service endpoints, as described in *Postinstallation configuration - OpenShift Container Platform 4.22* (https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.22/html-single/postinstallation_configuration/index_chunk_497).

## Root cause

`payments-api` is healthy but returns **503** because its PostgreSQL dependency is out of client connection slots.

- Critical alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` — **100%** payment failures.
- `payments-api` logs: PostgreSQL rejects requests with:
  ```
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```
- PostgreSQL is configured for **20** connections, with **3** reserved for superusers—only **17** are available to applications.

## Dependency findings

| Dependency | Namespace | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| `postgres` | `shared-services` | Running | Reachable, but saturated |
| `reporting-service` | `shared-services` | Running | **Cause of saturation** |
| `reconciliation-service` | `shared-services` | CrashLoopBackOff | Separate misconfiguration |

`reporting-service` (`v1.0.2`, pod `10.128.2.248`) holds **16 idle-in-transaction** PostgreSQL sessions. Each is a `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`, open for 2–5 minutes. Its logs show it opens a new connection every 10 seconds, then fails with `division by zero`, apparently without closing or rolling back the transaction. This consumes all application slots and blocks payments.

## Other issue

`reconciliation-service` has no ready endpoints because probes call **HTTP on port 8443**, while the container declares port **8080** and is serving TLS on 8443. The probe receives HTTP 400 / connection refused, causing CrashLoopBackOff. It is not the direct payment failure cause.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Stop the leak immediately:** restart or scale down `shared-services/reporting-service` to release its 16 connections. This is temporary.
2. **Fix reporting-service v1.0.2:** correct the divide-by-zero path and ensure every error path closes connections and rolls back transactions; use bounded pooling.
3. **Correct reconciliation probes:** target the actual listener and use `scheme: HTTPS` if retaining port 8443; otherwise configure the service to listen on 8080.
4. **Do not treat increasing `max_connections` as the primary fix**—it only delays recurrence.

The payments service itself has a ready endpoint and no pod failures. OpenShift recommends inspecting pod events while troubleshooting workload behavior; no payment-pod event errors were found.

## Root cause

`payments-api` is healthy and has a ready Service endpoint, but every request returns **503** because PostgreSQL is out of non-superuser connection slots.

- `PaymentErrorRateHigh` is firing at **100%**.
- Payments logs: `remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`.
- Dependency: `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432` is reachable and has a ready endpoint.

## Cause in `shared-services`

`reporting-service` is leaking database connections:

- Current PostgreSQL activity: **16 connections** from reporting pod `10.128.2.248`, user `dbuser`, all **idle in transaction**.
- Reporting logs repeatedly show:
  - `Open db connection`
  - `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`

Its error path is apparently not closing/rolling back connections. This exhausted PostgreSQL’s available client slots and blocks both reporting and payment requests.

## Other dependency health

- **PostgreSQL:** Running, but capacity exhausted; alerts `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` and `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` are active.
- **Reconciliation service:** `CrashLoopBackOff`; its HTTP probes use HTTP against port 8443 and receive `400`, leaving its Service with **no endpoints**. This is separate from the payment outage unless payments directly call it (the payments deployment only configures PostgreSQL).

## Recommended remediation

1. **Immediately stop or scale down `reporting-service`** to halt new leaked connections; then terminate its existing DB sessions or restart PostgreSQL if session termination is unavailable.
2. Fix reporting’s `division by zero` and ensure connections are closed/rolled back in exception handling; use bounded connection pooling.
3. Correct reconciliation probes to match the HTTPS listener/proper health path.
4. Add connection limits and alerts per application to prevent one workload from exhausting the shared database.

## Root cause

`payments-api` is healthy and reachable, but every payment request returns **503** because its PostgreSQL dependency is out of client connection slots.

Evidence:
- `PaymentErrorRateHigh` is firing at **100%**.
- `payments-api` logs:  
  `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- PostgreSQL logs show sustained, rapid connection failures with the same error.
- `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` is firing in `shared-services` (**18 active connections**).

The API connects to:

`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432/demo`

The Postgres pod and its Service/EndpointSlice are Running and have an endpoint, so this is **not** a DNS, Service, or network reachability failure.

## Cross-namespace dependency status

| Dependency | Namespace | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---:|---|
| PostgreSQL | `shared-services` | Running but saturated | Direct cause of payment 503s; connection capacity exhausted. |
| Reconciliation service | `shared-services` | `CrashLoopBackOff` | Separate issue. Its health probes use **HTTP** against port **8443**, where the RHEL httpd container expects TLS; probes return 400 and restart the pod. It is not configured as a direct `payments-api` dependency. |
| Reporting service | `shared-services` | Running | No issue observed. |

Additional concern: Postgres logs also show repeated invalid login attempts for nonexistent roles (`postgres`, `appuser`, `payments`, numeric OpenShift UIDs). These attempts appear to be contributing connection pressure and should be identified/stopped.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Immediately identify and terminate/reduce excess database clients**; determine whether the payment application leaks connections or whether another workload/client is repeatedly opening them.
2. Configure a **bounded connection pool** in `payments-api`; ensure connections are returned/closed and add backoff on DB failures.
3. Increase Postgres `max_connections` only after sizing memory and controlling clients—it mitigates symptoms but does not fix a leak or connection storm.
4. Fix `reconciliation-service` probes to match the endpoint protocol—use HTTPS on 8443 or change the probe/service port to the actual HTTP listener.

## Root cause

`payments-api` is healthy and reachable, but **100% of payment requests return 503** because its PostgreSQL dependency is out of normal connection slots.

- Payment logs: `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

- PostgreSQL: `max_connections=20`, with 3 reserved for superusers.

## Dependency findings

| Dependency | Namespace | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| `postgres` | `shared-services` | Running / endpoint healthy | Exhausted by 16 leaked sessions. |
| `reporting-service` v1.0.2 | `shared-services` | Running | Source of leak: its pod (`10.128.2.248`) opens a DB connection every 10s, then fails with `division by zero`, leaving each transaction idle. Sessions run `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`. |
| `reconciliation-service` | `shared-services` | CrashLoopBackOff / no endpoints | Separate fault: probes request HTTP on port `8443`, but the container declares `8080`; probes receive HTTP 400 or connection refused. It is not the direct cause of payment failures. |

`reporting-service` was rolled from **v1.0.1 to v1.0.2** immediately before the issue. Its logs show the recurring error and leaked connections, so v1.0.2 is the likely regression.

## Recommended recovery

1. **Roll back `reporting-service` to v1.0.1** (or deploy a fixed version that closes/rolls back connections on errors).
2. **Restart the reporting pod** after rollback to release its leaked sessions. If slots remain occupied, terminate only the stale sessions from `10.128.2.248` in PostgreSQL.
3. Correct `reconciliation-service` readiness/liveness probes to its actual listener/health endpoint—currently `8443` is wrong.
4. Add connection pooling and a timeout for idle-in-transaction sessions; do not rely solely on increasing `max_connections`.

The payments Service itself has a healthy endpoint (`10.128.2.247:8080`), so network routing and the payment pod are not the failure point.

| `reporting-service` | `shared-services` | Running but faulty | **Source of connection exhaustion** |
| `reconciliation-service` | `shared-services` | `CrashLoopBackOff` | Separate dependency failure; not evidenced as the payment outage cause |

The reporting pod (`10.128.2.248`) owns **16 connections**, all `idle in transaction`, using `dbuser`. Its logs show a cycle every 10 seconds:

1. Opens a DB connection.
2. Fails with `division by zero`.
3. Leaves the transaction/connection open.

That leak consumes the small PostgreSQL connection limit, preventing `payments-api` from connecting.

Additionally, `reconciliation-service` is crash-looping because its probes use **HTTP** against port **8443**, where its httpd container expects TLS; probes receive HTTP 400.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Immediate recovery:** stop or scale down `shared-services/reporting-service` to halt the leak, then clear its stranded idle-in-transaction PostgreSQL sessions. This restores connection capacity for payments.
2. **Permanent fix:** correct the reporting service’s divide-by-zero path and ensure connections/transactions are closed or rolled back on every error. Configure bounded connection pooling.
3. **Database hardening:** raise `max_connections` only after sizing memory and application pool limits; increasing it alone masks the leak.
4. **Separate fix:** correct reconciliation probes to use `HTTPS` on `8443` (or probe the actual HTTP listener/port).

````markdown
### Findings

**Primary cause:** PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`.

- `PaymentErrorRateHigh` is critical at **100%**.
- `payments-api` is healthy (`1/1 Running`), but every request returns `503`.
- Logs show:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- Active alerts report **18 PostgreSQL connections** and possible connection leaks.

**Other dependency failure:** `shared-services/reconciliation-service`

- Pod is `CrashLoopBackOff`; deployment has `0` ready replicas.
- Its Service has **no endpoints**.
- Probes use **HTTP on port 8443**, while Apache treats 8443 as TLS and returns `400`.
- Repeated liveness failures restart the container.

**Healthy dependencies**

- PostgreSQL pod: `2/2 Running`, endpoint available, but connections exhausted.
- Reporting service: `1/1 Running`, endpoint available.
- Cross-namespace DNS/service discovery is working—the payment API reaches PostgreSQL successfully before PostgreSQL rejects the connection.

### Recommended fix

1. Identify and terminate leaked/idle PostgreSQL sessions; restart the leaking client if necessary.
2. Add bounded connection pooling and ensure connections are closed.
3. Correct reconciliation probes—likely use `scheme: HTTPS` on `8443`, or probe the actual HTTP listener/health path.
4. Confirm the payment error-rate alert clears and reconciliation gains a ready endpoint.

### Root cause

`payments/payments-api` is healthy, but returns **HTTP 503** because PostgreSQL in `shared-services` has exhausted available connections:

> `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

The source is `shared-services/reporting-service` version `v1.0.2`:

- Repeatedly opens a DB connection every 10 seconds.
- Encounters `division by zero`.
- Leaves **16 connections idle in transaction** from pod IP `10.128.2.248`.
- This exhausts PostgreSQL and causes the payment error rate to reach **100%**.

### Other dependency issue

`shared-services/reconciliation-service` is also unhealthy:

- `CrashLoopBackOff`
- No Service endpoints
- Probes use **HTTP on port 8443**, while the Service/container declares port `8080`.
- Apache responds `400`, triggering liveness restarts.

This is separate from the immediate payment failure.

### Recommended recovery

1. Roll back or fix `reporting-service:v1.0.2`; ensure failed transactions are rolled back and connections closed.
2. Restart that pod or terminate its leaked PostgreSQL sessions to restore payment processing.
3. Add connection pooling and transaction timeouts.
4. Correct the reconciliation-service probe protocol/port/path.

- Alerts confirm **18 active connections** and possible connection leakage.
- PostgreSQL itself is `2/2 Running`, and its service endpoint is ready.

**Additional dependency failure:** `reconciliation-service` in `shared-services` is `CrashLoopBackOff`.

- Its probes use **HTTP** against port `8443`.
- Apache on `8443` expects HTTPS, so probes return HTTP `400`.
- Failed liveness probes repeatedly terminate the container.
- Its service has only a **not-ready endpoint**, so it cannot receive traffic.
- `reporting-service` is healthy with a ready endpoint.

### Recommended fixes

1. **Immediate recovery:** terminate leaked/idle PostgreSQL sessions or restart the responsible workload/database after confirming impact.
2. **Permanent fix:** correct application connection pooling and ensure connections are closed; do not rely solely on increasing `max_connections`.
3. Fix reconciliation probes to use `scheme: HTTPS` on `8443`, or probe the actual HTTP application port/path.
4. Add a startup probe or longer initial delay if Apache initialization requires more time.

OpenShift removes pods from service endpoints when readiness probes fail and restarts containers when liveness probes fail: *Postinstallation configuration — OpenShift Container Platform 4.22*.

- Active alerts:
  - `PaymentErrorRateHigh`: **100%**, critical
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections`: critical, **18 active connections**
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh`: warning

### Cross-namespace dependencies

| Dependency | Status |

| `shared-services/postgres` | Running, but connection-exhausted |
| `shared-services/reporting-service` | Healthy (`1/1`) |
| `shared-services/reconciliation-service` | `CrashLoopBackOff`, no ready endpoint |

The reconciliation deployment is also misconfigured:

- Container exposes port `8080`.
- Health probes target port `8443` using plain HTTP.
- Apache on `8443` expects HTTPS, so probes return `400`.
- Liveness failures repeatedly restart the pod.
- Its Service endpoint is consequently marked `notReady`.

### Recommended fix

1. Identify and terminate leaked/idle PostgreSQL sessions, then correct application connection pooling/closure.
2. Adjust PostgreSQL `max_connections` only as a temporary mitigation.
3. Fix reconciliation probes to use the actual protocol/port—likely HTTPS on `8443`, or HTTP on the configured application port.
4. Verify payment errors and database connection counts return to normal afterward.

The critical `PaymentErrorRateHigh` alert reports a **100% payment error rate**.

### Dependency findings

- **PostgreSQL:** Running and reachable at `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`, but connections are exhausted.
- **Likely connection leak:** `reporting-service` was upgraded from `v1.0.1` to **`v1.0.2`**. It opens a database connection every 10 seconds, hits `division by zero`, and appears not to close the connection. Exhaustion began shortly afterward.
- **Reconciliation service:** Independently broken:
  - `CrashLoopBackOff`
  - Probes use plain HTTP against port `8443`; Apache returns HTTP 400.
  - Service exposes port `8080`, while probes target `8443`.
  - Its endpoint is marked **not ready**.
- **Reporting service endpoint:** Ready, despite its application/database errors.

### Recommended recovery

1. Roll back `shared-services/reporting-service` to `v1.0.1` or fix `v1.0.2` to close connections on exceptions.
2. Terminate its leaked PostgreSQL sessions or restart PostgreSQL for immediate recovery.
3. Correct reconciliation probes to match the actual protocol/port—likely HTTPS on `8443`—and align the Service `targetPort`.

### Findings

**Root cause:** PostgreSQL in `shared-services` exhausted its connection slots.

- `PaymentErrorRateHigh` is critical at **100%**.
- `payments-api` is healthy as a pod, but every request returns **503**:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- PostgreSQL is running and reachable, but has **18 active connections** and is rejecting new ones.
- `reporting-service` repeatedly opens database connections while failing with `division by zero`, strongly indicating a connection leak.
- `reconciliation-service` is also unavailable:
  - `CrashLoopBackOff`
  - Probes query HTTP on port `8443` and receive `400`.
  - Its Service has **no endpoints**.
  - The container declares port `8080`, so probe port/protocol configuration is inconsistent.

### Recommended actions

1. **Stop or roll back `reporting-service` v1.0.2** to halt the likely connection leak.
2. Terminate leaked/idle PostgreSQL sessions or restart PostgreSQL for immediate recovery.
3. Fix `reporting-service` to close connections on error and resolve the division-by-zero failure.
4. Fix `reconciliation-service` probes to match its actual listener, likely port `8080` or HTTPS on `8443`.
5. Add connection pooling, limits, and timeouts. Increasing PostgreSQL `max_connections` alone only postpones recurrence.

### Investigation Summary

The `payments-api` service in the `payments` namespace is failing customer requests with **503 Service Unavailable** errors. 

#### Root Cause:
- **PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion:** The backend database (`postgres` in the `shared-services` namespace) has exhausted its available connection pool slots (`FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`).
- As a result, incoming payment requests fail when attempting to connect to the database.

#### Cross-Namespace Dependencies & Issues:
1. **`shared-services` Namespace (`postgres`):** Experiencing high connection saturation from various workloads, leading to maxed-out connection slots.
2. **`shared-services` Namespace (`reconciliation-service`):** Currently in a `CrashLoopBackOff` loop, which may be attempting frequent retries or exacerbating database connectivity issues.
3. **`shared-services` Namespace (`reporting-service`):** Running normally, but also shares access to the same database.

#### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Check database connection limits and active connections on the PostgreSQL instance.
2. Investigate why the `reconciliation-service` is crash-looping.
3. Scale down or fix dependent services leaking database connections if necessary.

#### Root Cause:
1. **PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion:** The backend PostgreSQL database (`postgres` in the `shared-services` namespace) is configured with a very low connection limit (`max_connections = 20`).
2. **Idle-in-Transaction Connections:** Multiple client connections are stuck in the `idle in transaction` state (held by `dbuser`), exhausting all available worker connection slots.
3. **Superuser Reservation:** Non-superuser roles are failing with:
   > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

---

### Dependency Analysis in Other Namespaces (`shared-services`)

The `payments-api` service depends on shared services running in the `shared-services` namespace:
* **`postgres` (`shared-services`):** The shared PostgreSQL database instance. It is actively running, but its connection pool is fully saturated due to unclosed database transactions/sessions.
* **`reporting-service` (`shared-services`):** Running normally, but also attempts connections to the same database.
* **`reconciliation-service` (`shared-services`):** Currently in a **`CrashLoopBackOff`** state, adding further instability and error noise in the shared environment.

The investigation reveals that the payment service (`payments-api` in the `payments` namespace) is failing due to a **database connection exhaustion** issue on the shared PostgreSQL backend (`postgres` in the `shared-services` namespace).

### Cause & Dependency Analysis:
1. **Root Cause:** 
   - The PostgreSQL database has exhausted its available connection slots (`FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`).
   - Consequently, incoming requests to `payments-api` result in HTTP 503 errors and database connection failures.
2. **Dependencies & Contributing Factors (`shared-services` namespace):**
   - **`postgres` Service:** Currently hitting connection limits, likely exacerbated by connection leaks or high concurrency across the dependent applications.
   - **`reconciliation-service`:** Is currently in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state, repeatedly attempting to connect or restart, which contributes to connection churn and resource contention against the shared database.

### Summary of Investigation

The **`payments-api`** service in the **`payments`** namespace is failing requests with **HTTP 503** because it cannot establish a connection to its backend PostgreSQL database in the **`shared-services`** namespace.

---

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Payment Service (`payments` namespace):**
   - **Error:** `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
   - **Impact:** All incoming transaction requests fail because PostgreSQL connection limits have been exhausted.

2. **PostgreSQL Database (`shared-services` namespace):**
   - Database `postgres` has `max_connections` set to **20** (via `postgres-init` ConfigMap).
   - Firing alert: `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` / `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh`.

3. **Dependency Issue – Connection Leak in `reporting-service` (`shared-services` namespace):**
   - The `reporting-service` (v1.0.2) attempts to process pending reports every 10 seconds and crashes on a calculation error:
     ```text
     ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
     ```
   - Each failed attempt opens a database connection without releasing/closing it, rapidly leaking connections until the 20-connection pool limit is reached.

4. **Additional Dependency Issue – `reconciliation-service` (`shared-services` namespace):**
   - Pod is in **`CrashLoopBackOff`**.
   - **Cause:** Probes are configured for `httpGet` with plain `HTTP` against port `8443`, but Apache is serving `HTTPS`/TLS, resulting in HTTP 400 responses and probe failure restarts.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Fix the Connection Leak & Division by Zero in `reporting-service`:**
   - Fix the zero-division bug and ensure database connections are wrapped in `try...finally` blocks to guarantee connection release.
   - Restart or scale down `reporting-service` temporarily to release the leaked connections immediately:
     ```bash
     oc scale deployment reporting-service -n shared-services --replicas=0
     oc scale deployment reporting-service -n shared-services --replicas=1
     ```
2. **Increase PostgreSQL Connection Limit (Optional/Tuning):**
   - Adjust `max_connections` in `postgres-init` ConfigMap or PostgreSQL configuration if higher concurrency is required.
3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes:**
   - Update `reconciliation-service` deployment probes to use `scheme: HTTPS` or point to the plaintext HTTP port (`8080`).

### Investigation Summary

The **`payments-api`** service in the **`payments`** namespace is failing requests with `503 Service Unavailable` because it cannot establish a connection to its shared database dependency in the **`shared-services`** namespace.

---

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion (`shared-services/postgres`)**:
   - PostgreSQL (`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`) is configured with `max_connections = 20`.
   - All non-superuser connection slots are exhausted, resulting in:
     ```text
     FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
     ```
   - Alerts firing: `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` and `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (100% error rate).

2. **Connection Leak from `reporting-service` (`shared-services`)**:
   - The `reporting-service` opens a database connection every 10 seconds and fails with an unhandled exception:
     ```text
     ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
     ```
   - Failed connections are not closed/released, consuming all available connection slots on PostgreSQL.

---

### Additional Dependency Issues (`shared-services`)

* **`reconciliation-service`** is in `CrashLoopBackOff`:
  - Liveness/readiness probes are sending plain `HTTP` requests to port `8443` (configured for HTTPS), receiving `400 Bad Request` and failing health checks.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Fix `reporting-service`**:
   - Patch the `division by zero` bug and ensure database connections are properly managed and closed in `finally`/defer blocks or connection pooling.
   - Restart the `reporting-service` pod/deployment to release leaked connections.
2. **PostgreSQL Configuration**:
   - Increase `max_connections` or implement a connection pooler (e.g., PgBouncer) if higher concurrency is required.
3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Health Probes**:
   - Update probe `scheme` to `HTTPS` or point the probes to an appropriate HTTP port/endpoint.

---

### Dependency Status in `shared-services`

1. **`postgres` (Database)**:
   - **Status:** Running (`postgres-5bd4d575fb-7vlxk`).
   - **Issue:** PostgreSQL is configured with `max_connections = 20`. All available connection slots have been exhausted by connection leaks from client services.

2. **`reporting-service` (Connection Leak Source)**:
   - **Status:** Running (`reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg`), image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`.
   - **Issue:** Continually encounters `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero` every 10 seconds and opens a new database connection without releasing the previous ones, consuming all available PostgreSQL connection slots.

3. **`reconciliation-service`**:
   - **Status:** **`CrashLoopBackOff`** (`reconciliation-service-587768b96f-v7v9z`).
   - **Issue:** Liveness/readiness probes targeting `http://:8443/` fail with HTTP 400 Bad Request against Apache/httpd.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Fix `reporting-service`**:
   - Roll back to a previous stable version (e.g., `v1.0.1`) or scale the deployment down temporarily (`oc scale deployment reporting-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services`) to release leaked connections.
2. **Restart PostgreSQL / Terminate Idle Connections**:
   - Restart the PostgreSQL pod (`oc rollout restart deployment/postgres -n shared-services`) or terminate inactive connections to immediately restore connection slots for `payments-api`.
3. **Fix `reconciliation-service`**:
   - Update probes in the deployment manifest to use HTTPS (`scheme: HTTPS`) or point to the correct HTTP port (`8080`).

```

---

### Investigation of Dependencies (`shared-services` Namespace)

1. **PostgreSQL Database (`postgres-5bd4d575fb-7vlxk`)**:
   - `max_connections` is configured to `20`.
   - The connection pool is completely consumed by abandoned connections in the `idle in transaction` state.

2. **Reporting Service (`reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg`)**:
   - **Connection Leak**: Periodically executes queries (`SELECT count(*) FROM reports`) and encounters an unhandled exception:
     ```text
     ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
     ```
   - Because the error is unhandled, database connections are not closed and remain open in an `idle in transaction` state, consuming all available connection slots.

3. **Reconciliation Service (`reconciliation-service-587768b96f-v7v9z`)**:
   - Currently in **`CrashLoopBackOff`**.
   - **Health Probe Misconfiguration**: The liveness/readiness probes send plain HTTP requests to port `8443` (an SSL/HTTPS port on Apache HTTPD), causing HTTP 400 probe failures.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Fix `reporting-service`**:
   - Resolve the application `division by zero` error and ensure database connections/transactions are closed properly in a `finally` block or connection pool.
   - Restart the pod or scale down `reporting-service` temporarily to release the leaked connections immediately.
2. **Increase Database Limits / Add Pooling**:
   - Increase `max_connections` in PostgreSQL or deploy a connection pooler (such as PgBouncer).
3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes**:
   - Update the liveness and readiness probe configuration to use `scheme: HTTPS` or point to the standard HTTP port (`8080`).

### Investigation Summary

#### 1. Root Cause in the `payments` Namespace
* **Service Affected:** `payments-api`
* **Error:** Returning `503 Service Unavailable` on payment transactions.
* **Cause:** The API cannot connect to the shared database:
  ```text
  connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.91.126), port 5432 failed: 
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```

---

#### 2. Dependency Health in the `shared-services` Namespace

* **`reporting-service` (Root Trigger for DB Outage):**
  * **Issue:** Fails every 10 seconds with `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`.
  * **Impact:** Opens a new PostgreSQL connection on every iteration without closing it, causing a database connection leak that exhausted all available PostgreSQL connection slots.

* **`postgres`:**
  * **Status:** Running, but unable to serve application traffic because all non-superuser connection slots are held by leaked connections.

* **`reconciliation-service` (Secondary Issue):**
  * **Status:** `CrashLoopBackOff`
  * **Cause:** Liveness and readiness probes fail because they send plain `HTTP` requests to the TLS/HTTPS port (`8443`), returning HTTP `400 Bad Request`.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Immediate Relief for `payments-api`:**
   * Restart or scale down `reporting-service` in `shared-services` to immediately terminate the leaked connections:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     ```
2. **Fix `reporting-service`:**
   * Fix the `division by zero` logic error.
   * Ensure database connections are wrapped in `try...finally` blocks to guarantee connection closure on error.
3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes:**

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion:**
   * **Target:** `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`
   * **Error:** `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
   * The database has reached its maximum connection limit and refuses incoming connections from non-superuser roles.

2. **Connection Leak in `reporting-service` (`shared-services` namespace):**
   * **Pod:** `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg`
   * **Issue:** The service opens a new database connection every 10 seconds (`Open db connection`) and immediately fails with `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero` without closing the connection. This leaks connections until the PostgreSQL connection pool is completely exhausted.

### Status of Dependencies in `shared-services`

| Service | Status | Findings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`postgres`** | Running | Out of available connection slots due to the leak. |
| **`reporting-service`** | Running (Faulty) | Causing connection leaks due to unhandled `division by zero` exceptions. |
| **`reconciliation-service`** | `CrashLoopBackOff` | Failing liveness/readiness probes (probes use HTTP GET against port `8443` configured for SSL/HTTPS, returning HTTP 400). |

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Fix/Restart `reporting-service`:**
   * Scale down or restart `reporting-service` in `shared-services` to immediately free up the leaked PostgreSQL connections.
   * Patch `reporting-service` to handle the `division by zero` exception and ensure database connections are closed or managed via a connection pool.
2. **Fix `reconciliation-service`:**
   * Update the liveness and readiness probe schemes to `HTTPS` (or point them to the correct HTTP port `8080`).

### Root Cause Analysis

The **`payments-api`** service in the **`payments`** namespace is failing with `HTTP 503 Service Unavailable` because it cannot establish a connection to its backend PostgreSQL database located in the **`shared-services`** namespace.

The database error logged by `payments-api` is:
```text
connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.91.126), port 5432 failed: 
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

---

### Cross-Namespace Dependency Status (`shared-services`)

1. **PostgreSQL Database (`postgres`):**
   - **Max Connections:** Configured to `20`.
   - **Issue:** All available client connection slots are exhausted by lingering connections in the `idle in transaction` state.

2. **Reporting Service (`reporting-service` - Primary Cause of Exhaustion):**
   - **Image:** `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`
   - **Issue:** Every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` attempts to query reports and encounters:
     ```text
     ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
     ```
   - **Connection Leak:** Upon encountering this unhandled error, the service does not close the database connection. Over time, multiple leaked connections hold active transactions (`idle in transaction`), consuming all 20 connection slots and starving `payments-api`.

3. **Reconciliation Service (`reconciliation-service`):**
   - **Status:** In `CrashLoopBackOff` (6+ restarts).
   - **Issue:** Health probes are configured for plain HTTP on port `8443` (an HTTPS/TLS endpoint), causing probes to receive `HTTP 400 Bad Request` and repeatedly restart the container.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Mitigate Database Connection Exhaustion:**
   - Restart or scale down the `reporting-service` deployment in `shared-services` to terminate the leaked connections:
     ```bash
     oc scale deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services --replicas=0
     ```
   - If needed, restart PostgreSQL or terminate idle backend connections.
2. **Fix `reporting-service`:**
   - Roll back to `v1.0.1` or fix the `division by zero` logic and add proper database connection lifecycle handling (`finally`/connection closing).
3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes:**
   - Update liveness/readiness probes to use `scheme: HTTPS` on port `8443` or point to an HTTP port.

### Findings & Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. Payment Service Failure
* **Namespace:** `payments`
* **Pod:** `payments-api-*`
* **Symptom:** All transactions fail with `HTTP 503 Service Unavailable`.
* **Direct Cause:** `payments-api` cannot connect to its database dependency:
  ```text
  connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local", port 5432 failed: 
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```

---

#### 2. Cross-Namespace Dependencies (`shared-services`)

`payments-api` depends on the **`postgres`** database service located in the `shared-services` namespace.

* **Primary Root Cause — Connection Leak in `reporting-service`:**
  * **Image:** `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`
  * **Issue:** Fails every 10 seconds with `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`.
  * **Impact:** Every failure opens a new PostgreSQL connection without closing it, causing a database connection leak that exhausts all available PostgreSQL connection slots (triggering `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` / `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` alerts).

* **Secondary Issue — `reconciliation-service` in `CrashLoopBackOff`:**
  * **Pod:** `reconciliation-service-*`
  * **Issue:** The pod is failing liveness/readiness probes. The probes send plaintext `HTTP` requests to port `8443`, which is configured for `HTTPS/TLS`, resulting in `HTTP 400 Bad Request` and container restarts.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Resolve Database Connection Exhaustion:**
   * Roll back `reporting-service` to `v1.0.1` or deploy a fix for the division-by-zero error and connection handling.
   * Restart `reporting-service` and/or `postgres` in `shared-services` to clear stale connections.
2. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes:**
   * Update the deployment's liveness and readiness probe schemes to `HTTPS` (or target the HTTP port `8080` instead of `8443`).

### Root Cause

The **`payments-api`** service in the **`payments`** namespace is failing with HTTP 503 errors because it cannot establish a connection to its database dependency: **`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`**.

The PostgreSQL database has reached its connection capacity (`max_connections = 20`), throwing the error:
`FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

---

### Dependency Analysis (`shared-services` Namespace)

1. **`reporting-service` (Connection Leak Root Cause):**
   - Periodically executes reports and encounters an unhandled exception: `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`.
   - Failed executions leave connections open in an `idle in transaction` state (`SELECT count(*) FROM reports`).
   - These leaked connections occupy all non-superuser connection slots in the PostgreSQL instance, blocking the payment service from connecting.

2. **`postgres`:**
   - Operating at maximum connection limits due to connection exhaustion from `reporting-service`.

3. **`reconciliation-service` (Additional Finding):**
   - In `CrashLoopBackOff` state due to failing readiness/liveness probes configured against port 8443 over HTTP.

---

### Recommended Remediation

1. **Fix `reporting-service`:**
   - Resolve the `division by zero` error in the reporting logic and ensure database transactions/connections are properly closed in `finally` / error handling blocks.
   - Restart the `reporting-service` pod or terminate idle transactions in PostgreSQL (`pg_terminate_backend`) to immediately free connection slots.
2. **PostgreSQL Configuration:**
   - Consider increasing `max_connections` or placing a connection pooler (such as PgBouncer) in front of PostgreSQL.

2. **`reporting-service` (Root Cause of Database Exhaustion)**
   * **Status:** Running with continuous application errors.
   * **Issue:** Throws `ERROR: Failed to process pending reports: division by zero` every 10 seconds and leaks database connections on each failure without closing them, quickly exhausting all available PostgreSQL connection slots.

3. **`reconciliation-service` (Probe Misconfiguration)**
   * **Status:** `CrashLoopBackOff` (`SharedServicesPodCrashLooping` alert firing).
   * **Issue:** Apache httpd is configured for TLS on port `8443`, but liveness and readiness probes use `scheme: HTTP` to port `8443`, resulting in HTTP 400 Bad Request probe failures and container restarts.

### Recommended Remediation
1. **Resolve Database Connection Exhaustion:**
   * Restart or scale down `reporting-service` to immediately free up leaked database connections so `payments-api` can reconnect.
   * Fix the `division by zero` bug and implement proper connection closing/connection pooling in `reporting-service`.
2. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Health Probes:**
   * Update the liveness and readiness probes in the `reconciliation-service` deployment to use `scheme: HTTPS` on port 8443 (or configure an unencrypted HTTP health check endpoint).

### Root Cause of Payment Service Failures

The `payments-api` service in the `payments` namespace is failing 100% of customer requests with **HTTP 503** because it cannot connect to the shared database:
```text
connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local", port 5432 failed:
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

---

### Dependency Analysis (`shared-services` Namespace)

#### 1. PostgreSQL Database (`postgres`)
* **Issue:** Connection pool exhaustion. PostgreSQL is configured with `max_connections = 20`. All available application connection slots are exhausted.
* **Alerts Firing:** `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` and `PostgresqlTooManyConnections`.

#### 2. Reporting Service (`reporting-service`) — *Root Cause of Connection Exhaustion*
* **Issue:** Connection leak.
* **Details:** Following an upgrade to `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`, the service attempts a periodic job every 10 seconds:
  ```text
  INFO Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
  The unhandled `division by zero` exception prevents connection closure, leaking a new connection every 10 seconds until PostgreSQL slots are depleted.

#### 3. Reconciliation Service (`reconciliation-service`) — *Secondary Failure*
* **Status:** In `CrashLoopBackOff` (0/1 Ready).
* **Alerts Firing:** `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping` and `SharedServicesDeploymentReplicasMismatch`.
* **Issue:** Health check misconfiguration. Probes specify `scheme: HTTP` against port `8443`:
  ```yaml
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /
      port: 8443
      scheme: HTTP
  ```
  Because port `8443` is serving TLS/HTTPS, plain HTTP requests fail with `400 Bad Request`, causing probe failures and container restarts.

---

### Recommended Remediation

1. **Resolve Database Connection Exhaustion:**
   * **Roll back or patch `reporting-service`:** Roll back to image `v1.0.1` (or fix connection handling on errors in `v1.0.2`).
   * **Restart `reporting-service` pod:** Releasing leaked connections will immediately restore connectivity for `payments-api`.

2. **Fix `reconciliation-service` CrashLoopBackOff:**
   * Update the deployment probe `scheme` to `HTTPS` (or change the probe port to HTTP port `8080`).

The `payments-api` service in the **`payments`** namespace is failing customer requests with **HTTP 503** because it cannot establish a connection to its database dependency in the **`shared-services`** namespace:

```
ERROR Payment failed tx=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.91.126), port 5432 failed:
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

---

### Dependency Analysis (`shared-services` Namespace)

1. **PostgreSQL (`postgres`)**:
   - `max_connections` is configured to **20** in `postgres-init`.
   - All non-superuser connection slots have been completely exhausted.

2. **`reporting-service` (Source of Connection Leak)**:
   - Fails every 10 seconds with:
     ```
     INFO Open db connection
     ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
     ```
   - Each failed attempt opens a database connection without closing it, leaking connections until the PostgreSQL connection limit is reached.

3. **`reconciliation-service` (Unhealthy Dependency)**:
   - Currently in **`CrashLoopBackOff`** (6+ restarts).
   - The deployment defines HTTP liveness and readiness probes (`scheme: HTTP`) against port `8443` (an Apache SSL/TLS port). Apache responds with `HTTP 400 Bad Request`, causing kubelet to repeatedly fail probes and restart the container.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Immediate Relief (Free PostgreSQL Connections)**:
   - Scale down or restart the `reporting-service` deployment to immediately drop leaked connections:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     ```
   - If connections do not clear immediately, restart the `postgres` pod.

2. **Fix `reporting-service`**:
   - Fix the `division by zero` error and ensure database connections are wrapped in `try...finally` / context managers so connections close on error.

3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Health Checks**:
   - Update `reconciliation-service` probes to use `scheme: HTTPS` or target the non-SSL port `8080`.

4. **Database Resilience**:
   - Increase `max_connections` in `postgres-init` or introduce a connection pooler (e.g., PgBouncer).

### Root Cause

The **`payments-api`** service in the **`payments`** namespace is failing with HTTP 503 errors because its database connection attempts to PostgreSQL are rejected:
```text
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```
PostgreSQL's connection pool (`max_connections = 20`) is completely exhausted.

---

### Dependency Analysis (`shared-services` namespace)

1. **`postgres` (Database)**
   - Configured with `max_connections = 20`.
   - All non-superuser connection slots are held open by leaked transactions.

2. **`reporting-service` (Connection Leak Source)**
   - Every 10 seconds, it initiates a transaction (`SELECT count(*) FROM reports`) and crashes with a `division by zero` error.
   - It fails to close or roll back connections on error, leaving 18+ connections hanging in an `idle in transaction` state and exhausting the database pool.

3. **`reconciliation-service` (`CrashLoopBackOff`)**
   - In a crash loop due to failed liveness and readiness probes.
   - Probes send plain HTTP requests (`scheme: HTTP`) to port `8443`, which is configured for HTTPS/TLS, causing Apache to return `400 Bad Request` and repeatedly restart the container.

---

### Recommended Remediation

- **Immediate Relief:** Restart the `reporting-service` pod (or scale it down) to terminate the orphaned database connections:
  ```bash
  oc rollout restart deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
  ```
- **Fix `reporting-service`:** Add error handling to ensure database connections are released/closed upon exceptions, and fix the `division by zero` logic.
- **Fix `reconciliation-service`:** Update the pod probes in the deployment to use `scheme: HTTPS` on port 8443 (or probe the HTTP port 8080).
- **PostgreSQL Configuration:** Consider raising `max_connections` or placing a connection pooler (such as PgBouncer) in front of the database.

### Root Cause

The `payments-api` service in the `payments` namespace is failing with **HTTP 503** errors because its database connection to PostgreSQL in the `shared-services` namespace is rejected:

```text
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

---

### Dependency Analysis (`shared-services` namespace)

#### 1. **PostgreSQL (`postgres-5bd4d575fb-7vlxk`)**
* **Connection limit:** `max_connections` is set to **20** (via `postgres-init` ConfigMap), with **3** slots reserved for superusers (`superuser_reserved_connections`), leaving only **17** connections for regular users (`dbuser`).
* **Connection exhaustion:** All 17 available non-superuser connection slots are completely exhausted.

#### 2. **Reporting Service (`reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg` - IP: `10.128.2.248`)**
* **Root cause of exhaustion:** The reporting service attempts to process pending reports every 10 seconds and crashes with `division by zero`.
* It opens a new database connection on each iteration without closing the previous one upon failure.
* As a result, it holds **16 orphaned connections** stuck in `idle in transaction` executing `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`.

#### 3. **Reconciliation Service (`reconciliation-service-587768b96f-v7v9z`)**
* **Status:** `CrashLoopBackOff`.
* **Issue:** The pod's liveness and readiness probes send plain `HTTP` requests to port `8443`, which is configured for `HTTPS`/TLS (Apache `httpd`), returning HTTP 400 Bad Request and triggering restart loops.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Clear Leaked Connections / Mitigate Immediately:**
   * Restart or scale down `reporting-service` in `shared-services` to terminate leaked connections:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     ```
   * Or terminate idle backend connections directly in PostgreSQL:
     ```sql
     SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE usename = 'dbuser' AND state = 'idle in transaction';
     ```

2. **Fix `reporting-service`:**
   * Fix the `division by zero` logic error.
   * Ensure database connections are properly managed with connection pooling and closed inside `try/finally` blocks or context managers.

3. **Increase PostgreSQL Connection Limit:**
   * Update `max_connections` in `shared-services/postgres-init` ConfigMap or PostgreSQL configuration to a higher limit suitable for all dependent workloads.

4. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes:**
   * Update the liveness/readiness probes in `reconciliation-service` Deployment to either use `scheme: HTTPS` on port 8443 or target the HTTP port `8080`.

### Root Cause

The **`payments-api`** service in the `payments` namespace is failing 100% of customer requests with HTTP **503 Service Unavailable** because it cannot connect to its database dependency: **`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`**.

PostgreSQL rejects connections with:
`FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

---

### Dependency Analysis (`shared-services` namespace)

1. **`postgres` (Database Saturated)**
   - **Configuration:** `max_connections = 20`, with `superuser_reserved_connections = 3` (only 17 slots available for applications).
   - **Status:** All non-superuser connection slots are completely exhausted. Alert `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` is firing.

2. **`reporting-service` (Connection Leaker)**
   - Every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` initiates a connection to PostgreSQL as `dbuser`.
   - Queries fail with `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`.
   - The application fails to release or roll back the connection upon error, leaving 16 connections stuck in `idle in transaction` state and exhausting the database pool.

3. **`reconciliation-service` (`CrashLoopBackOff`)**
   - Failing independently due to misconfigured HTTP liveness and readiness probes pointing to HTTPS port 8443 (returning `400 Bad Request`).

---

### Remediation Steps

1. **Mitigate database exhaustion:**
   - Restart or scale down the `reporting-service` deployment in `shared-services` to terminate leaked connections:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     # or
     oc scale deployment/reporting-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
     ```
   - Restart the `payments-api` pod or verify connections recover:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/payments-api -n payments
     ```

2. **Fix `reporting-service` application bug:**
   - Fix the `division by zero` calculation error in pending report processing.
   - Implement proper database connection management (`finally` / connection closing / connection pooling).
   - Consider rolling back `reporting-service` from `v1.0.2` to `v1.0.1`.

3. **Adjust PostgreSQL configuration:**
   - Increase `max_connections` in `postgres-init` ConfigMap and database configuration to accommodate cluster workloads.

4. **Fix `reconciliation-service` probes:**
   - Update `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` scheme to `HTTPS` (or target HTTP port 8080) in `deployment/reconciliation-service`.

### Root Cause Analysis

The **payment service** (`payments-api` in the `payments` namespace) is failing requests with **HTTP 503** errors because it cannot establish a connection to its database dependency:

```text
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

---

### External Dependencies & Breakdown

#### 1. PostgreSQL Database (`postgres` in `shared-services`)
* **Service:** `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`
* **Status:** Database connections are exhausted.
* **Configuration:** PostgreSQL has `max_connections = 20` configured.
* **Alerts Firing:** 
  * `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (Critical): 18 active connections detected.
  * `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (Critical): 100% payment error rate.

#### 2. Connection Leak Culprit: `reporting-service` in `shared-services`
* Inspection of `pg_stat_activity` shows all connection slots are consumed by client IP `10.128.2.248`, which belongs to `reporting-service`.
* Each leaked connection is stuck in state `idle in transaction` executing:
  ```sql
  SELECT count(*) FROM reports
  ```
* Logs from `reporting-service` reveal that every 10 seconds, it opens a DB connection and encounters an unhandled exception:
  ```text
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
  The connection is never closed or rolled back, leaking connections until PostgreSQL reaches its connection limit and rejects new connections from `payments-api`.

*(Note: `reconciliation-service` in `shared-services` is also in `CrashLoopBackOff` due to misconfigured health probes targeting port 8443 via HTTP instead of HTTPS, but is not the cause of the payment failure).*

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Stop the Connection Leak:**
   * Scale down or fix the `reporting-service` deployment to stop leaking connections:
     ```bash
     oc scale deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services --replicas=0
     ```
2. **Clear Leaked PostgreSQL Connections:**
   * Restart the PostgreSQL pod (or terminate idle backend connections in Postgres using `pg_terminate_backend`) to immediately free connection slots for `payments-api`:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/postgres -n shared-services
     ```
3. **Prevent Future Recurrence:**
   * Fix the `division by zero` application error and connection cleanup logic in `reporting-service`.
   * Increase `max_connections` or introduce a connection pooler (such as PgBouncer) to prevent a single service from starving other workloads.

### Cause of Failure

The **`payments-api`** service in the **`payments`** namespace is returning **HTTP 503** on customer requests (`/api/v1/process-payment`) because it cannot establish a connection to its database:

```text
connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.91.126), port 5432 failed: 
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

---

### Dependency Analysis (`shared-services` Namespace)

Investigation of the downstream services in the **`shared-services`** namespace revealed the following:

#### 1. PostgreSQL (`postgres`) Connection Pool Exhaustion (Root Cause)
* **Configuration:** PostgreSQL has `max_connections = 20` with `superuser_reserved_connections = 3`, leaving only **17 usable connection slots** for application roles.
* **Connection Leak:** All 16 available client connection slots are consumed and stuck in the `idle in transaction` state by **`reporting-service`** (`10.128.2.248`), leaving zero available slots for `payments-api`.

#### 2. `reporting-service` (Culprit of Connection Exhaustion)
* The deployment was updated to image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`.
* Every 10 seconds, it opens a connection and runs `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`, which fails with:
  ```text
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
* Due to an unhandled exception without proper cleanup/rollback, it leaks the database connection into an `idle in transaction` state, quickly exhausting all connection slots.

#### 3. `reconciliation-service` (Additional Broken Dependency)
* The pod is in **`CrashLoopBackOff`** (restarted 7+ times).
* **Cause:** The liveness and readiness probes are configured with `scheme: HTTP` against port `8443`, but the container (`httpd-24`) is configured with SSL/TLS on that port. Probes fail with `HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 400`, repeatedly killing the container.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Restore Payment Traffic:**
   * Restart or scale down `reporting-service` to terminate the leaked connections:
     ```bash
     oc scale deployment reporting-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
     ```
   * Alternatively, roll back `reporting-service` to `v1.0.1`.
   * Terminate active `idle in transaction` backends in PostgreSQL:
     ```sql
     SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE usename = 'dbuser' AND state = 'idle in transaction';
     ```

2. **Fix `reporting-service`:**
   * Address the `division by zero` error and ensure database connections and transactions are wrapped in a `try...finally` block to close/roll back connections upon error.

3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes:**
   * Update the liveness/readiness probes in the `reconciliation-service` deployment to use `scheme: HTTPS` on port 8443, or probe the unencrypted port 8080.

### Root Cause Analysis

The **`payments-api`** service in the `payments` namespace is failing customer requests with **HTTP 503 (Database unavailable)** due to connection exhaustion on its backend PostgreSQL database.

FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

---

### External Dependency Status (`shared-services` namespace)

#### 1. **PostgreSQL (`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`)**
* **Status:** Connection pool exhausted.
* **Details:** PostgreSQL is configured with `max_connections = 20` and `superuser_reserved_connections = 3`, allowing only 17 non-superuser connections. All non-superuser slots are currently consumed.

#### 2. **Reporting Service (`reporting-service`) — Cause of Connection Exhaustion**
* **Status:** Running, but leaking database connections.
* **Root Cause:** Following an update to image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`, the service has a division-by-zero bug (`x = total / 0`). In each run (every 10s), it opens a PostgreSQL connection and appends it to a persistent list before crashing on division by zero without closing the connection. This leaks connections until the PostgreSQL limit is reached.

#### 3. **Reconciliation Service (`reconciliation-service`)**
* **Status:** `CrashLoopBackOff`
* **Root Cause:** Unrelated probe configuration issue. Liveness and readiness probes send plain HTTP requests (`scheme: HTTP`) to port `8443`. Because `httpd` is configured for TLS/SSL on port 8443, requests fail with `HTTP 400 Bad Request`, causing Kubernetes to continuously kill and restart the container.

---

### Recommended Remediation

1. **Fix `reporting-service`:** Roll back to `v1.0.1` or fix the connection leak and zero-division error in `v1.0.2`:
   ```bash
   oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
   ```
2. **Release Leaked Connections:** Restart the `postgres` pod or terminate idle connections in PostgreSQL:
   ```bash
   oc rollout restart deployment/postgres -n shared-services
   ```
3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes:** Update `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` to use `scheme: HTTPS` on port 8443, or target port 8080 over HTTP.

## 🔴 Root Cause: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion

The **payment service** (`payments-api`) in the `payments` namespace is returning **100% errors (HTTP 503)** because it cannot connect to its PostgreSQL database in the `shared-services` namespace.

### The Chain of Failure

#### 1. PostgreSQL Connection Pool Exhausted (`shared-services` namespace)
- **`max_connections` = 20**, with **3 reserved for superuser** → only **17 slots** available for regular users.
- **16 connections are stuck in `idle in transaction` state** by user `dbuser` on the `demo` database, plus **2 active** connections from user `demo`.
- **Total: 18 of 17 available slots consumed** → PostgreSQL rejects all new connections with:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

#### 2. `reporting-service` is Leaking Connections (`shared-services` namespace)
- The `reporting-service` pod opens a new DB connection **every 10 seconds** (`"Open db connection"`) but encounters a `division by zero` error during processing.
- It appears to **never close/release connections** after the error, causing them to pile up in `idle in transaction` state.
- This is the **connection leak** that exhausted the pool.

#### 3. `reconciliation-service` is CrashLooping (`shared-services` namespace)
- Running the wrong image: `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` (a generic Apache HTTPD image, not a reconciliation service).
- Health probes target port **8443 over HTTP**, but the container serves HTTPS on that port → probes get **HTTP 400** → liveness probe kills the container → **CrashLoopBackOff** (7 restarts).
- This is a **separate misconfiguration** but contributes to the overall system degradation.

---

### 🛠️ Recommended Fixes (in priority order)

**1. Immediate — Stop the connection leak (fix `reporting-service`):**
- The `reporting-service` has a bug: it opens DB connections but doesn't close them on error. Restart the pod to release the leaked connections, then fix the application code to properly close connections in error handlers (or use a connection pool with limits).
  ```
  oc delete pod reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg -n shared-services
  ```
  > ⚠️ This is a temporary fix. The `division by zero` bug will cause connections to leak again.

**2. Short-term — Increase PostgreSQL `max_connections`:**
- 20 is very low for a shared database serving multiple services. Consider increasing it to at least 100.

**3. Fix `reconciliation-service` deployment:**
- Deploy the correct container image (not `httpd-24`).
- Fix the health probe: either change the scheme to `HTTPS` or change the port to match the actual application endpoint.

**4. Application fix — `reporting-service` code:**
- Fix the `division by zero` bug.
- Implement proper connection management (use `try/finally` or a connection pool) to prevent future leaks.

## 🔴 Root Cause: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion

The **payment service** (`payments` namespace) is returning **503 errors on 100% of requests** because it cannot connect to its PostgreSQL database in the `shared-services` namespace.

### The Chain of Failure

**1. PostgreSQL Connection Pool Exhausted (`shared-services` namespace)**
- `max_connections` = **20** (very low)
- `superuser_reserved_connections` = **3** (so only **17 slots** for regular users)
- **16 connections are stuck in `idle in transaction` state** by user `dbuser` on the `demo` database
- Only 1 usable slot remains (occupied by 2 active `demo` user queries), leaving **zero slots** for new connections

**2. `reporting-service` is leaking connections (`shared-services` namespace)**
- It opens a new DB connection every **10 seconds** (`"Open db connection"`) but appears to never close them properly
- It also has a **`division by zero`** application bug causing repeated failures
- These leaked connections accumulate as `idle in transaction`, consuming all available slots

**3. `payments-api` is completely blocked (`payments` namespace)**
- Every payment attempt fails with: `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- All requests return **HTTP 503**
- Alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` at **100%** (critical)

**4. `reconciliation-service` is CrashLooping (`shared-services` namespace)**
- Running the wrong image (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` — a generic Apache HTTPD, not a reconciliation service)
- Health probes target port **8443** with **HTTP** scheme, but the container serves HTTPS on that port → probes return **400** → container gets killed repeatedly
- **7 restarts**, currently in `CrashLoopBackOff`

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Fixes (in priority order)

### Immediate — Restore Payment Processing
1. **Kill the leaked idle connections** on PostgreSQL to free slots. You can exec into the postgres pod and run:
   ```sql
   SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'idle in transaction' AND usename = 'dbuser';
   ```

2. **Increase `max_connections`** on the PostgreSQL deployment (e.g., to 100+) to provide headroom. Update the postgres ConfigMap or environment variable.

### Fix the `reporting-service` Connection Leak
3. The `reporting-service` opens a new connection every 10 seconds but never releases them. The application code needs to **close connections after use** or use a **connection pool**. Additionally, the **`division by zero`** bug needs to be fixed in the application logic.

### Fix the `reconciliation-service`
4. **Wrong container image** — it's running `httpd-24` (Apache web server) instead of an actual reconciliation service. Deploy the correct image.
5. **Health probe misconfiguration** — probes use `scheme: HTTP` on port `8443` (which serves HTTPS). Either change the scheme to `HTTPS` or point probes to the correct port/path.

Here's the full investigation summary:

## 🔴 Root Cause Analysis: Payment Service Failure

### The Chain of Failure

**1. PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion (shared-services namespace)**

The PostgreSQL database (`postgres-5bd4d575fb-7vlxk` in `shared-services`) is configured with:
- **`max_connections` = 20**
- **`superuser_reserved_connections` = 3**
- Usable connections for regular users: **17**

Currently, **16 connections are stuck in `idle in transaction`** state by user `dbuser` on the `demo` database, plus 2 active connections = **18 total**. This exceeds the 17 non-superuser slots, so all new connections are rejected with:

> `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

**2. Reporting Service — Connection Leak (shared-services namespace)**

The `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg` pod is the **likely source of the connection leak**:
- It opens a new DB connection every **10 seconds** (`"Open db connection"`)
- It hits a **`division by zero`** error on every attempt
- It **never closes/releases the connection** after the error — the connections pile up as `idle in transaction`
- This has been happening since startup (~10:08), gradually exhausting all available slots

**3. Reconciliation Service — CrashLooping (shared-services namespace)**

- `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-v7v9z` has **restarted 7 times**
- It's running an **httpd** container with a liveness probe hitting port `8443` over HTTP (but the server uses HTTPS on that port → returns 400)
- The probe fails → container gets killed → restarts → crash loop
- Its logs also show `FATAL: role "postgres" does not exist` and `FATAL: role "admin" does not exist`, indicating misconfigured DB credentials

**4. Payment Service — 100% Error Rate (payments namespace)**

- `payments-api-559656657c-fqvhw` is Running (1/1) and healthy
- **Every payment transaction fails** because it cannot connect to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`
- All requests return **HTTP 503**
- The `PaymentErrorRateHigh` critical alert confirms **100% error rate**

## ✅ Recommended Remediation

**Immediate (restore payment processing):**
1. **Restart the reporting-service** pod to release the 16 leaked `idle in transaction` connections:
   ```
   oc delete pod reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg -n shared-services
   ```
   ⚠️ This is a temporary fix — the leak will recur.

**Short-term fixes:**
2. **Fix the reporting-service** application code — the `division by zero` bug causes it to skip connection cleanup. Connections must be closed/released in a `finally` block.
3. **Fix the reconciliation-service** Deployment:
   - Change the liveness/readiness probe to use `scheme: HTTPS` (port 8443 serves HTTPS)
   - Fix the DB credentials (roles `postgres` and `admin` don't exist)
4. **Set `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`** on PostgreSQL to auto-kill leaked connections (currently 0 = disabled).

**Long-term:**
5. **Increase `max_connections`** beyond 20 if multiple services share this database.
6. **Implement connection pooling** (e.g., PgBouncer) in front of PostgreSQL.

Would you like me to restart the reporting-service pod to immediately restore payment processing?

Here's the full investigation summary:

## 🔴 Root Cause: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion in `shared-services`

The **payment service** (`payments` namespace) is returning **100% HTTP 503 errors** because it cannot connect to its PostgreSQL database in the `shared-services` namespace. The database has **run out of connection slots**.

### Database Connection Breakdown

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `max_connections` | **20** (very low) |
| `superuser_reserved_connections` | 3 |
| Available for regular users | **17** |
| **Currently "idle in transaction"** | **16** (by user `dbuser`) |
| Currently active | 2 (by user `demo`) |

**16 connections are stuck in "idle in transaction" state** held by user `dbuser`, consuming nearly all available slots. This means no new connections can be established by any service.

### Affected Services (Cascade Failure)

| Service | Namespace | Status | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **payments-api** | `payments` | Running but 100% errors | Every payment request fails with `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute` |
| **reporting-service** | `shared-services` | Running but erroring | Alternates between `division by zero` bugs and connection failures |
| **reconciliation-service** | `shared-services` | CrashLoopBackOff (7 restarts) | Wrong container image (`rhel9/httpd-24` instead of an actual reconciliation app); liveness/readiness probes failing with HTTP 400 |

### Active Alerts Confirming This

- 🔴 **PaymentErrorRateHigh** (critical) — 100% error rate
- ⚠️ **PostgresqlTooManyConnections** — 18 active connections detected
- ⚠️ **PostgresqlConnectionsHigh** — connection usage high
- ⚠️ **SharedServicesPodCrashLooping** — reconciliation-service crash looping
- ⚠️ **SharedServicesDeploymentReplicasMismatch** — reconciliation-service has no ready replicas

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate — Kill idle transactions** to free connection slots:
   - Connect to the PostgreSQL pod as superuser and run:
     ```sql
     SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'idle in transaction' AND usename = 'dbuser';
     ```

2. **Increase `max_connections`** — 20 is far too low for multiple services. Increase to at least 100 in the PostgreSQL configuration (ConfigMap or Deployment env vars), then restart the pod.

3. **Fix the reporting-service** — It has a `division by zero` application bug that needs a code fix. It's also opening new DB connections every 10 seconds without proper pooling, which contributes to connection exhaustion.

4. **Fix the reconciliation-service** — It's deployed with the wrong image (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` — a generic Apache HTTPD image, not a reconciliation service). The Deployment needs to be updated with the correct application image.

5. **Add connection pooling** — Consider deploying PgBouncer or a similar connection pooler in front of PostgreSQL to prevent future exhaustion.

## 🔴 Root Cause: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion

The **payment service** (`payments` namespace) is failing **100% of customer requests** because it cannot connect to its PostgreSQL database in the `shared-services` namespace.

### The Chain of Failure

| Component | Namespace | Status | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| `payments-api` | `payments` | Running (1/1) | Every request returns **HTTP 503** — cannot get a DB connection |
| `postgres` | `shared-services` | Running (2/2) | **Connection pool exhausted** |
| `reporting-service` | `shared-services` | Running (1/1) | **Connection leak** — opens connections every 10s, never closes them |
| `reconciliation-service` | `shared-services` | CrashLoopBackOff (7 restarts) | Liveness/readiness probe misconfiguration |

### Detailed Breakdown

**1. PostgreSQL is saturated:**
- **`max_connections` = 20**
- **`superuser_reserved_connections` = 3** → only **17 usable slots** for regular users
- **Current backends on `demo` DB = 18** (already exceeding the non-superuser limit)
- **16 connections are `idle in transaction`** by user `dbuser` — these are **leaked connections** that were opened but never committed/rolled back

**2. `reporting-service` is the leak source:**
- Logs show it opens a new DB connection (`"Open db connection"`) every **10 seconds**
- It then hits a `division by zero` error but **never closes/releases the connection**
- Over time, this has consumed all 17 available connection slots (16 idle-in-transaction + 2 active = 18 total)

**3. `reconciliation-service` is crash-looping (separate issue):**
- It's running a generic **httpd** image (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`) — likely the wrong image for a reconciliation service
- Liveness/readiness probes target port **8443** via **HTTP** (not HTTPS), but httpd on 8443 is serving HTTPS → probes get **HTTP 400** → container gets killed repeatedly

### Recommended Fixes

**Immediate — Restore payment processing:**
1. **Kill the leaked connections** on PostgreSQL to free up slots:
   ```sql
   SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity 
   WHERE state = 'idle in transaction' AND usename = 'dbuser';
   ```
2. You can exec into the postgres pod to run this.

**Short-term — Fix the reporting-service:**
- Fix the `division by zero` bug in the application code
- Ensure DB connections are properly closed in error/finally handlers (connection pooling with proper cleanup)

**Short-term — Fix the reconciliation-service:**
- Deploy the correct container image (not a generic httpd)
- Or fix the probes: change the scheme to `HTTPS` on port 8443, or point probes to port 8080 with `HTTP`

**Long-term — Harden PostgreSQL:**
- Increase `max_connections` (currently only 20 — very low)
- Set `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` to auto-kill leaked connections
- Add a connection pooler like PgBouncer in front of PostgreSQL

Would you like me to terminate the leaked idle connections on PostgreSQL to restore payment processing immediately?

## 🔴 Root Cause: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion

The **payment service** (`payments` namespace) is returning **100% HTTP 503 errors** because it cannot connect to its PostgreSQL database in the `shared-services` namespace.

### The Chain of Failure

| Component | Namespace | Status | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| `payments-api` | `payments` | Running (1/1) | ❌ All requests failing with 503 |
| `postgres` | `shared-services` | Running (2/2) | ❌ Connection slots exhausted |
| `reporting-service` | `shared-services` | Running (1/1) | ⚠️ Connection leak + `division by zero` bug |
| `reconciliation-service` | `shared-services` | CrashLoopBackOff (7 restarts) | ❌ Misconfigured health probes |

### Database Connection Breakdown

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `max_connections` | **20** (very low!) |
| `superuser_reserved_connections` | **3** |
| Available for regular users | **17** |
| Currently used (`demo` DB) | **18** |
| Connections in `idle in transaction` state | **16** (by user `dbuser`) |

**The smoking gun:** **16 connections are stuck in `idle in transaction`** state held by user `dbuser`. This is a **connection leak** — the `reporting-service` opens a new DB connection every 10 seconds (visible in its logs: `"Open db connection"`), hits a `division by zero` error, and **never closes/commits the transaction**, leaving connections dangling.

With only 20 `max_connections` and 16 leaked + 2 active = 18 used, the remaining 2 slots are reserved for superusers, so the `payments-api` gets rejected with:
> `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

### Additional Issue: `reconciliation-service` CrashLoopBackOff

This pod has a **separate, independent problem**:
- It's running `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24` (an Apache HTTPD image — likely wrong image for a reconciliation service)
- Health probes target port **8443** using **HTTP** scheme, but the container serves HTTPS on 8443 → probes get HTTP 400 responses
- The liveness probe failures cause repeated container kills → CrashLoopBackOff

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Fixes

### Immediate (restore payment processing):

1. **Kill the leaked connections** — Connect to PostgreSQL as superuser and terminate idle-in-transaction sessions:
   ```sql
   SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity 
   WHERE state = 'idle in transaction' AND usename = 'dbuser';
   ```

2. **Restart the `reporting-service`** to stop the connection leak:
   ```bash
   oc delete pod reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg -n shared-services
   ```
   ⚠️ Note: This will only temporarily fix the leak — the `division by zero` bug will cause it to leak again.

### Short-term:

3. **Fix the `reporting-service` application bug** — The `division by zero` error is the root cause of the leak. The code needs to properly handle errors and close/rollback transactions in error paths.

4. **Increase `max_connections`** on PostgreSQL (e.g., to 100+) to provide more headroom.

5. **Set `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`** on PostgreSQL to automatically kill leaked connections (e.g., `SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '60s';`).

### For the `reconciliation-service`:

6. **Fix the health probes** — Either change the scheme to `HTTPS` or change the probe port to `8080` (the declared container port). Also verify this is the correct container image for this service.

## 🔴 Root Cause: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion

The **payment service** (`payments-api`) is returning **100% HTTP 503 errors** because it cannot connect to the shared PostgreSQL database in the `shared-services` namespace.

### The Chain of Failure

#### 1. PostgreSQL Connection Pool Saturated (`shared-services` namespace)
- **`max_connections` = 20** (very low)
- **`superuser_reserved_connections` = 3** → only **17 usable slots** for applications
- **16 connections are stuck in `idle in transaction`** state by user `dbuser`
- **2 connections are `active`** from user `demo`
- **Total: 18 of 17 available slots consumed** → all new connections are rejected with:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

#### 2. `reporting-service` is Leaking Connections (`shared-services` namespace)
- Opens a new DB connection **every 10 seconds** (`"Open db connection"`)
- Hits a **`division by zero`** bug and fails — but **never closes/releases the connection**
- This is the likely source of the 16 `idle in transaction` connections, draining the pool

#### 3. `reconciliation-service` is CrashLooping (`shared-services` namespace)
- Running image `rhel9/httpd-24` (a generic Apache HTTPD — likely wrong image for a reconciliation service)
- **Liveness/readiness probes misconfigured**: probing port `8443` with `scheme: HTTP`, but the container listens on HTTPS at `8443` → returns **HTTP 400**, failing the probes
- Container is killed and restarted repeatedly (7 restarts, now in `CrashLoopBackOff`)
- This is a **secondary issue** — not the direct cause of payment failures, but another broken dependency

#### 4. `payments-api` Cannot Process Any Requests (`payments` namespace)
- Every payment transaction fails because it can't get a DB connection
- All requests return **HTTP 503**
- Alert `PaymentErrorRateHigh` is firing at **critical** severity (100% error rate)

---

### 🛠️ Recommended Fixes (in priority order)

| Priority | Issue | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **P0** | Connection leak in `reporting-service` | Fix the application code: close DB connections in error/finally blocks, and fix the `division by zero` bug. As an **immediate mitigation**, restart the `reporting-service` pod to release the leaked connections. |
| **P0** | `max_connections` too low | Increase PostgreSQL `max_connections` from 20 to a more appropriate value (e.g., 100+). Consider adding a connection pooler like PgBouncer. |
| **P1** | `reconciliation-service` CrashLoopBackOff | Fix the health probes — either change the scheme to `HTTPS` on port `8443`, or probe port `8080` (the declared container port) with `HTTP`. Also verify the correct application image is being used. |

### Immediate Mitigation

To restore payment processing **right now**, restart the `reporting-service` pod to release the leaked `idle in transaction` connections:

```
oc delete pod reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg -n shared-services
```

This will free up the connection slots and allow `payments-api` to connect to PostgreSQL again. However, the connections will leak again until the `reporting-service` code is fixed.

## 🔴 Root Cause: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion

The **payment service** (`payments` namespace) is returning **100% HTTP 503 errors** because it cannot connect to its PostgreSQL database in the `shared-services` namespace. Here's the full chain of failure:

### The Problem Chain

#### 1. PostgreSQL has a critically low connection limit
- **`max_connections = 20`** (set in the `postgres-init` ConfigMap via `ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 20`)
- **`superuser_reserved_connections = 3`** → only **17 usable slots** for regular users

#### 2. `reporting-service` (shared-services) is leaking connections
- The `reporting-service` (v1.0.2) opens a **new DB connection every 10 seconds** (`"Open db connection"`) but **never closes them**
- It's also hitting a **`division by zero`** bug on every iteration, but continues running and accumulating connections
- Currently **16 connections are `idle in transaction`** from user `dbuser` — all leaked by this service
- With 2 active connections from user `demo`, that's **18 of 17 available slots consumed**

#### 3. `payments-api` (payments namespace) is completely blocked
- Every payment transaction fails with: `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- All requests return **HTTP 503** — **100% error rate**

#### 4. `reconciliation-service` (shared-services) is also broken — but for a different reason
- It's deployed with the **wrong container image**: `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` (a generic Apache HTTPD image, not a reconciliation service)
- Health probes target port **8443** using **HTTP** scheme, but the container listens on 8443 with **HTTPS** (SSL), causing probe failures (HTTP 400)
- Result: **CrashLoopBackOff** (7 restarts)
- This is a separate misconfiguration, not directly causing the payment outage

---

### 🛠️ Recommended Fixes (in priority order)

**Immediate — Restore payment processing:**
1. **Fix the `reporting-service` connection leak** — The application code (v1.0.2) needs to properly close DB connections after use. As a quick mitigation, restart the pod to release the 16 leaked connections:
   ```
   oc delete pod reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg -n shared-services
   ```
   ⚠️ This is temporary — connections will leak again until the code is fixed. Consider rolling back to v1.0.1 if it didn't have this bug.

2. **Increase `max_connections`** — 20 is far too low for multiple services. Update the `postgres-init` ConfigMap and restart PostgreSQL, or exec into the pod and run `ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 100;` followed by a restart.

**Secondary — Fix reconciliation-service:**
3. **Deploy the correct container image** for `reconciliation-service` — it's currently using a generic HTTPD image instead of the actual reconciliation service application.
4. **Fix the health probe scheme** — if the service uses HTTPS on port 8443, change the probe scheme from `HTTP` to `HTTPS`.

Would you like me to help execute any of these fixes?

I'll start by investigating the payment service issue. Let me check alerts, events, and the pods in the payments namespace simultaneously.I can see several critical findings already:

1. **`PaymentErrorRateHigh` (CRITICAL)** — Payment error rate is **100%**, far exceeding the 15% threshold.
2. **`PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (CRITICAL)** — 18 active DB connections in `shared-services` namespace.
3. **`SharedServicesPodCrashLooping`** — `reconciliation-service` in `shared-services` is crash looping.

The payment pod itself is Running (1/1). Let me dig deeper into the payment pod logs and the shared-services dependencies.The picture is becoming very clear. Let me now check the crash-looping reconciliation service logs and the PostgreSQL pod to understand the connection exhaustion.Let me check the current PostgreSQL connection count and the reporting service's connection leak behavior.Now I have the complete picture. Here's the full investigation summary:

## 🔴 Root Cause: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion

The **`reporting-service`** in the `shared-services` namespace has a **connection leak** that has saturated the shared PostgreSQL database, causing a cascading failure to the `payments-api`.

### Chain of Events

#### 1. `reporting-service` (shared-services) — Connection Leak 🐛
- The `reporting-service` (v1.0.2) opens a **new DB connection every 10 seconds** (`"Open db connection"`) but **never closes them**.
- Each iteration hits a **`division by zero`** application bug, but the connection is not released.
- This has accumulated **16 connections stuck in `idle in transaction`** state (user: `dbuser`), plus 2 active connections (user: `demo`).

#### 2. PostgreSQL (shared-services) — Saturated 💀
- **`max_connections = 20`**, with **3 reserved for superuser**.
- Usable slots: **17**. Currently consumed: **18** (16 idle-in-transaction + 2 active).
- **All non-superuser connection slots are exhausted**, so PostgreSQL rejects every new connection with:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

#### 3. `payments-api` (payments) — 100% Error Rate 📉
- The payment service connects to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`.
- Every payment transaction is **rejected by PostgreSQL** → returns **HTTP 503** to customers.
- Alert: **`PaymentErrorRateHigh` (CRITICAL)** — 100% error rate.

#### 4. `reconciliation-service` (shared-services) — CrashLoopBackOff 🔄
- This pod is running the **wrong image** (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` — a generic Apache HTTPD, not a reconciliation service).
- Its liveness/readiness probes target port **8443** with HTTP (not HTTPS), getting **400 Bad Request** from Apache's HTTPS-only listener → fails probes → gets killed → CrashLoopBackOff (7 restarts).
- This is a **separate misconfiguration** but not the primary cause of the payment outage.

---

### 🛠️ Recommended Fix (Priority Order)

1. **Immediate — Kill the leaked connections**: Restart the `reporting-service` pod to release the 16 leaked `idle in transaction` connections:
   ```
   oc delete pod reporting-service-6d7f67656f-n8ztg -n shared-services
   ```
   ⚠️ This will only provide **temporary relief** — the leak will recur.

2. **Short-term — Fix the reporting-service bug**: The `division by zero` error and connection leak in `reporting-service` v1.0.2 need an application code fix. Connections must be properly closed/returned to a pool, especially in error paths.

3. **Short-term — Increase `max_connections`**: The PostgreSQL `max_connections=20` is very low for a shared database serving multiple services. Consider increasing it to at least 100.

4. **Fix the reconciliation-service**: The deployment is using the wrong container image (`httpd-24` instead of a proper reconciliation service image), and the probes are misconfigured (HTTP to an HTTPS port).

Would you like me to restart the `reporting-service` pod now to restore payment processing?

## 🔴 Root Cause: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion

The **payment service** (`payments` namespace) is failing **100% of customer requests** because the shared **PostgreSQL database** (`shared-services` namespace) has **run out of connection slots**.

### Connection Numbers
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **`max_connections`** | **20** (very low) |
| **`superuser_reserved_connections`** | 3 |
| **Available for regular users** | 17 |
| **Current backends** | **18** (saturated) |
| **Idle-in-transaction (leaked)** | **16** ← the culprit |

### What's Happening
1. **16 connections** from user `dbuser` are stuck in **`idle in transaction`** state on the `demo` database — these are **leaked connections** (transactions opened but never committed/rolled back).
2. This exhausts all 17 available non-superuser slots, so every new connection attempt gets:
   > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
3. The `payments-api` pod is healthy and running, but **every payment request returns HTTP 503** because it can't connect to PostgreSQL.

### Cascade Impact in `shared-services` Namespace

| Service | Status | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| **postgres** | ✅ Running | Connection slots exhausted by leaked connections |
| **reporting-service** | ⚠️ Running but erroring | `division by zero` bug + intermittent DB connection failures |
| **reconciliation-service** | 🔴 CrashLoopBackOff (7 restarts) | Misconfigured health probes — liveness/readiness probe on **port 8443** (HTTPS) using **HTTP scheme**, getting 400 errors. Container itself is an `httpd` image, not a reconciliation app. |

### Firing Alerts
- **`PaymentErrorRateHigh`** (critical) — 100% error rate
- **`PostgresqlTooManyConnections`** (critical) — 18 active connections
- **`SharedServicesPodCrashLooping`** — reconciliation-service crash loop
- **`SharedServicesDeploymentReplicasMismatch`** — reconciliation-service has 0 ready replicas

## 🛠️ Recommended Fixes

### Immediate — Terminate Leaked Connections
Connect to the PostgreSQL pod as superuser and kill the idle-in-transaction sessions:
```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'idle in transaction' AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();
```

### Short-term
1. **Increase `max_connections`** — 20 is far too low for 3+ services. Set to at least 100.
2. **Set `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`** on PostgreSQL (e.g., `30s`) to auto-kill leaked transactions.
3. **Fix the reporting-service** — it has a `division by zero` application bug that needs a code fix.
4. **Fix the reconciliation-service** — the health probes target port `8443` with `scheme: HTTP`, but the container listens on HTTPS at that port (returning 400). Either change the scheme to `HTTPS` or point probes to port `8080`.

### Long-term
- Implement **connection pooling** (e.g., PgBouncer) in front of PostgreSQL.
- Ensure all application services properly close DB connections/transactions.
- Add connection pool size limits in each application's DB client configuration.

Would you like me to help terminate the leaked connections or apply any of these fixes?
