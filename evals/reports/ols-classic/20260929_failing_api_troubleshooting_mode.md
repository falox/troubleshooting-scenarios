# Scenarios

## failing_api_alert_cross_namespace

Alert fires for 100% payment error rate (payments-api returns
503).
RCA: reporting-service in shared-services leaks database connections,
exhausting the shared PostgreSQL pool; payments-api in payments cannot
acquire a connection.
Expected: identify shared-services/reporting-service as the root cause;
shared-services/reconciliation-service CrashLooping is a separate issue,
not the cause.

**Tags**: `core`, `difficulty_hard`, `alert`, `classic`

### Query

```
The payment service in the payments namespace is failing customer requests. Can you investigate the cause and check its dependencies in other namespaces?

Diagnosis: the `payments/payments-api` service is failing because its PostgreSQL dependency in `shared-services` has exhausted non-superuser connection slots. The likely source of the leak is `shared-services/reporting-service`.

**Evidence**

- Active alert:
  - `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments`: **100% error rate**
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` and `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` in `shared-services`

- `payments` workload status:
  - Deployment: `payments/payments-api`
  - Pod: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
  - Route: `payments-api-payments.apps.afalossi.4.260926.ccxdev.devshift.net`
  - Pod is `Running` and `Ready`, so this is not a crash/startup issue.

- `payments-api` logs show every request is failing on DB connect:
  - Example at `2026-09-29 09:37:52,061`:
    - `connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
    - request returned `503`
  - Same error repeats for all sampled requests.

- Cross-namespace dependency configured in the deployment:
  - `payments/payments-api` env:
    - `PGHOST=postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
    - `PGPORT=5432`
    - `PGDATABASE=demo`

- PostgreSQL capacity is very small and is exhausted:
  - `pg_settings_max_connections = 20`
  - `pg_settings_superuser_reserved_connections = 3`
  - Current activity:
    - `dbuser idle in transaction = 16`
    - `demo active = 2`
  - That leaves no usable non-superuser slots, matching the FATAL errors.

- Direct DB inspection from the postgres pod:
  - `dbuser | idle in transaction | 10.128.2.243 | 16`
  - Pod `10.128.2.243` is `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`

- `reporting-service` behavior strongly matches a connection leak:
  - Logs:
    - `2026-09-29 09:34:16,504 INFO Open db connection`
    - `2026-09-29 09:34:16,513 ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
    - repeats every 10 seconds
  - This suggests it opens DB connections and errors before closing them.
  - Trend confirms buildup:
    - `idle in transaction` for `dbuser` rose from **3 → 16** over the last 5 minutes.

**Root cause**

1. `payments-api` is healthy as a pod, but its database dependency `shared-services/postgres` is rejecting new client connections.
2. The strongest causal signal is `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`, which is repeatedly:
   - opening DB connections,
   - hitting `division by zero`,
   - leaving sessions `idle in transaction`,
   - consuming **16** of the available non-superuser slots.
3. Once those slots are consumed, `payments-api` requests fail with HTTP `503`.

**Other dependency findings**

- `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is also unhealthy:
  - `CrashLoopBackOff`
  - probes are misconfigured/failing with `HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 400`
- However, I found **no evidence** that `payments-api` depends on `reconciliation-service`.
- The only explicit cross-namespace dependency visible from `payments-api` is `shared-services/postgres`.

**Fix / mitigation**

1. **Immediate reversible mitigation:** stop the leaking client
   - Scale down or disable `shared-services/reporting-service` temporarily.
   - This should free DB slots and restore `payments-api`.

2. **Primary fix:** repair `reporting-service`
   - It appears to leak transactions/connections when the `division by zero` path occurs.
   - Fix the application to always rollback/close DB sessions on error.

3. **Hardening**
   - Increase DB connection handling resilience:
     - add connection pooling,
     - raise `max_connections` only if the DB size supports it,
     - set sane idle transaction timeouts.

4. **Separate issue**
   - Fix `reconciliation-service` probe/port configuration, but that is not the cause of payment request failures.

If you want, I can continue and apply the safest immediate mitigation path by identifying the least disruptive way to stop `reporting-service` from consuming DB connections.

Diagnosis

Root cause
1. `payments/payments-api` is failing because it cannot open PostgreSQL connections to `shared-services/postgres`.
   - Evidence: `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` logs from `2026-09-29 09:37:52Z` onward repeatedly show:
     - `connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
     - each failed request returns `503`
   - Evidence: active alert `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments` started at `2026-09-29T09:38:11Z` with `100.00%` error rate.

2. The PostgreSQL server in `shared-services` is saturated.
   - Evidence: active alerts in `shared-services`:
     - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` started `2026-09-29T09:36:11Z`
     - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` started `2026-09-29T09:37:41Z`
   - Evidence from live DB:
     - `max_connections = 20`
     - `superuser_reserved_connections = 3`
     - `pg_stat_database.numbackends (demo) = 18`
   - That leaves only reserved superuser slots, which exactly matches the payment error.

3. The connection pressure is being caused by `shared-services/reporting-service`, likely due a connection leak after its recent rollout.
   - Evidence: `reporting-service` was updated at `2026-09-29 09:34:15Z` from image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1` to `v1.0.2`.
   - Evidence: current pod `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` logs show every 10s:
     - `INFO Open db connection`
     - `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
   - Evidence from PostgreSQL:
     - `pg_stat_activity` shows `16` sessions for user `dbuser` in state `idle in transaction`
     - all `16` are from client IP `10.128.2.243`
   - Evidence from the pod:
     - `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` uses `PGUSER=dbuser`
     - its pod IP is `10.128.2.243`
   - Trend evidence:
     - `pg_stat_activity_count{state="idle in transaction",usename="dbuser"}` increased from `6` to `16` over the last 10 minutes.

Dependency check across namespaces

- `payments-api` dependency found in another namespace:
  - `shared-services/postgres` at service IP `172.30.172.15`, DNS `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
  - This dependency is unhealthy from a capacity standpoint, not from pod availability:
    - pod `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` is `Running 2/2`
    - service exists and resolves
    - failure is DB connection exhaustion

- Other `shared-services` anomaly:
  - `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is `CrashLoopBackOff`
  - cause: liveness/readiness probes hit `HTTP /` on port `8443` and receive `400`
  - alert `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping` is active
  - I found no evidence that `payments-api` depends on this service; the `payments-api` deployment only references PostgreSQL.

Most likely causal chain

1. `reporting-service` rolled to `v1.0.2`
2. it repeatedly opens DB connections and hits `division by zero`
3. connections remain `idle in transaction` and accumulate
4. PostgreSQL reaches `18/20` connections, leaving only reserved superuser slots
5. `payments-api` cannot obtain a DB connection and returns `503` for customer requests

Fix / mitigation

1. Immediate mitigation — reversible
   - Stop or scale down `shared-services/reporting-service` to release leaked DB sessions.
   - This should relieve pressure on `shared-services/postgres` and allow `payments-api` to recover.

2. Short-term mitigation — reversible
   - Terminate the leaked idle DB sessions for `dbuser`, or temporarily increase `max_connections` if restarting/scaling down reporting is not enough.
   - This restores service faster but does not fix the leak.

3. Corrective fix — non-reversible without another rollout
   - Roll back `shared-services/reporting-service` from `v1.0.2` to `v1.0.1`, or patch the app so it closes/rolls back DB transactions on the error path.
   - The `division by zero` path appears to be where connections are left open.

4. Secondary issue — reversible
   - Fix `shared-services/reconciliation-service` probe configuration (`8443` is being probed with HTTP and gets `400`).
   - This is separate from the payment outage.

Conclusion

The payment outage is caused by a failing cross-namespace dependency: `shared-services/postgres` has exhausted usable connections. The strongest evidence points to `shared-services/reporting-service:v1.0.2` leaking `dbuser` sessions (`16 idle in transaction` from pod `10.128.2.243`), which blocks `payments/payments-api` from connecting and causes customer-facing `503` errors.

Findings for `payments/payments-api`:

### Impact
- `payments-api` is returning **503** on customer requests.
- Active alert: **`PaymentErrorRateHigh`** in namespace `payments` with **100% error rate**.

### Evidence
1. **Payments pod is healthy at Kubernetes level, but failing at runtime**
   - Pod: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
   - Deployment: `payments/payments-api` is `1/1 Ready`
   - Recent app logs:
     - `2026-09-29 09:37:52,061 ERROR Payment failed ... FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
     - repeated for every request, followed by `GET /api/v1/process-payment ... 503`

2. **The failing dependency is PostgreSQL in another namespace**
   - Payments app is configured to use:
     - host: `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
     - database: `demo`
   - DB service:
     - `shared-services/postgres` → `172.30.172.15:5432`

3. **PostgreSQL is up, but connection slots are exhausted**
   - Postgres pod: `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
   - Postgres logs show repeated:
     - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
   - Live DB state from `pg_stat_activity`:
     - `max_connections = 20`
     - `superuser_reserved_connections = 3`
     - current sessions:
       - `dbuser | 10.128.2.243 | idle in transaction | 16`
       - plus 1 active `demo` session and internal sessions
   - Prometheus confirms:
     - `pg_settings_max_connections = 20`
     - `pg_settings_superuser_reserved_connections = 3`
     - `pg_stat_activity_count{usename="dbuser",state="idle in transaction"} = 16`
     - `pg_stat_database_numbackends` rose from **5** to **18** over the last 10 minutes

4. **The leaking client is `shared-services/reporting-service`**
   - `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` has IP `10.128.2.243`
   - That exactly matches the DB client address holding the 16 idle-in-transaction sessions.
   - Reporting service logs every 10s:
     - `INFO Open db connection`
     - `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
   - After enough leaked sessions accumulate, reporting also starts failing with:
     - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

5. **There is also a DB configuration issue**
   - Postgres startup log:
     - `parameter "max_connections" cannot be changed without restarting the server`
     - `configuration file ... contains errors`
   - So attempted tuning did **not** take effect; the DB is still limited to 20 connections.

### Root cause
`payments-api` itself is not broken. Customer requests fail because its shared PostgreSQL dependency in `shared-services` has no available non-superuser connection slots.

Primary cause of exhaustion:
1. **`shared-services/reporting-service` is leaking DB sessions** (`idle in transaction`) after hitting `division by zero`.
2. **Postgres is still running with only 20 max connections**, so the leak quickly exhausts the pool.

### Other dependency checks
- `shared-services/postgres`: **reachable but saturated**
- `shared-services/reporting-service`: **running but unhealthy at application level**; source of the leaked DB sessions
- `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`: **CrashLoopBackOff**, due misconfigured probes hitting `HTTP` on port `8443` and getting `400`. This is a separate issue; I found no evidence that `payments-api` depends on it.

### Fix / mitigation
**Immediate, reversible**
1. **Restart `shared-services/reporting-service`** to release leaked connections.
2. If slots do not recover fast enough, **restart `shared-services/postgres`** to clear sessions.

**Permanent**
1. Fix `reporting-service` so failed report processing does not leave transactions open.
2. Correct PostgreSQL configuration so `max_connections` is applied properly after restart.
3. Prefer a connection pooler / stricter connection management for apps using `dbuser`.

### Conclusion
Cause of the payment outage: **database connection exhaustion in `shared-services/postgres`, driven by leaked `idle in transaction` sessions from `shared-services/reporting-service`**. The payment service is healthy from a pod/deployment perspective but cannot obtain DB connections, so it returns 503s.

> Custom answer correctness: 0.99 - The response is essentially correct and closely matches the expected answer.

**Duration**: 1m 1s

**Tokens**: in 141,030 out 1,238

````markdown
Investigation result: the payment failures are caused by the shared PostgreSQL dependency in `shared-services`, not by the `payments` pod itself.

### Evidence

**Affected service**
- Namespace: `payments`
- Deployment: `payments-api`
- Pod: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
- Service: `payments-api`

**Payment pod is running, but requests fail**
- `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is `Running` and `Ready`.
- Its logs show repeated request failures:
  - `2026-09-29 09:37:52,061 ERROR Payment failed ... connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
  - Same error repeats for many transactions, each returning `503`.

**Alert correlation**
- Active alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments`
  - critical
  - description: `Payment error rate is 100.00%, which exceeds the 15% threshold.`
- Active alerts in `shared-services`:
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (critical)
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` (warning)

### Root cause

`payments-api` depends on:
- `PGHOST=postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
- `PGPORT=5432`
- `PGDATABASE=demo`

The PostgreSQL service in `shared-services` is up, but it has exhausted client connection slots.

**Database evidence**
- Pod: `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
- Service IP: `172.30.172.15`
- Inside the DB:
  - `max_connections = 20`
  - `pg_stat_activity` shows:
    - `dbuser | 10.128.2.243 | idle in transaction | 16`

`10.128.2.243` matches:
- Pod: `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`

So the connection slots are being consumed primarily by `reporting-service`.

### Why reporting-service is causing it

`reporting-service` logs show a repeating failure loop:
- `2026-09-29 09:34:16,504 INFO Open db connection`
- `2026-09-29 09:34:16,513 ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`

This repeats every 10s. Later it also starts failing to connect:
- `2026-09-29 09:36:36,594 ERROR ... FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved...`

Combined with the DB session view (`16 idle in transaction` from the reporting pod IP), this strongly indicates `reporting-service` is leaking DB sessions / leaving transactions open after errors.

### Dependency check in other namespaces

#### `shared-services/postgres`
- Status: `Running`
- Functional state: **degraded**
- Problem: connection exhaustion
- Supporting config:
  - ConfigMap `shared-services/postgres-init` contains:
    - `ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 20;`
- Note: postgres startup logs show:
  - `parameter "max_connections" cannot be changed without restarting the server`
  - but current runtime value is indeed `20`, confirmed via `SHOW max_connections;`

#### `shared-services/reporting-service`
- Status: `1/1 Running`
- Functional state: **bad actor / likely root cause**
- Evidence:
  - Pod IP `10.128.2.243` owns `16` idle DB transactions
  - Repeated app error: `division by zero`
  - Repeated DB opens without apparent cleanup

#### `shared-services/reconciliation-service`
- Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`
- Pod: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`
- Cause:
  - liveness/readiness probes hitting `HTTP` on port `8443`
  - events: `HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 400`
- This is a real issue in `shared-services`, but I found **no evidence** that `payments-api` depends on it. The `payments-api` pod configuration only points to PostgreSQL.

### Conclusion

1. **Immediate cause of customer-facing payment failures**
   - `payments-api` cannot get DB connections to `shared-services/postgres`.
   - This causes `503` responses for payment requests.

2. **Underlying root cause**
   - `shared-services/reporting-service` is leaking PostgreSQL connections after `division by zero` errors.
   - PostgreSQL is limited to `20` connections.
   - Most slots are stuck as `idle in transaction`, preventing `payments-api` from connecting.

3. **Additional dependency issue**
   - `shared-services/reconciliation-service` is crash looping due to probe misconfiguration, but this does **not** appear to be causing the payment outage.

### Recommended fix / mitigation

**Fastest reversible mitigation**
1. Restart or scale down `shared-services/reporting-service` to release leaked DB sessions.
2. If needed, restart `shared-services/postgres` only after dealing with `reporting-service`, otherwise the leak will recur quickly.

**Required permanent fix**
1. Fix `reporting-service` error path so DB connections/transactions are always closed or rolled back on exceptions.
2. Fix the `division by zero` bug in `reporting-service`.
3. Increase DB resilience:
   - raise `max_connections` if appropriate, and/or
   - add connection pooling.

**Separate fix**
- Correct `reconciliation-service` probes (`HTTP` to `8443` is returning `400`).

If you want, I can take the next step and identify the safest immediate mitigation in-cluster (for example, whether scaling `reporting-service` to 0 is sufficient before touching postgres).

Diagnosis

Root cause
1. payments/payments-api is failing because its database dependency in shared-services is out of PostgreSQL connection slots.
   - payments-api pod `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is `Running`, but its logs show repeated request failures:
     - `2026-09-29 09:37:50,470 ERROR Payment failed ... FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
     - Requests return `503` on `GET /api/v1/process-payment`.
   - The deployment is configured to use:
     - `PGHOST=postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
     - `PGPORT=5432`
     - `PGDATABASE=demo`
   - Active alert:
     - `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in namespace `payments`
     - Description: `Payment error rate is 100.00%`

Why PostgreSQL is exhausted
2. The shared PostgreSQL instance is configured with a very low connection cap, and another service is leaking connections.
   - `shared-services/postgres` is the DB used by payments.
   - PostgreSQL config from `ConfigMap/shared-services/postgres-init`:
     - `ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 20;`
   - Live DB state from `pg_stat_activity`:
     - `max_connections = 20`
     - `superuser_reserved_connections = 3`
     - `16` sessions from user `dbuser` at client `10.128.2.243`
     - all `16` are `idle in transaction`
   - Detailed activity shows those 16 leaked sessions all running:
     - `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`
     - each started every ~10s from `09:34:16` through `09:36:56`

Dependency investigation in other namespaces

Direct dependency affecting payments
3. The direct cross-namespace dependency is `Service/shared-services/postgres` (`172.30.172.15:5432`).
   - payments pod env points directly to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`.
   - That service is healthy at the pod level:
     - pod `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` is `2/2 Running`
   - But the service is functionally degraded because connection capacity is exhausted.

Service causing the DB pressure
4. `shared-services/reporting-service` is the main source of the DB exhaustion.
   - Pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` has IP `10.128.2.243`, matching the DB client IP holding the 16 leaked sessions.
   - Its logs show a repeating loop:
     - `INFO Open db connection`
     - `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
   - This repeats every 10 seconds and aligns exactly with the leaked DB sessions.
   - After enough leaked sessions accumulate, reporting-service also starts failing with the same PostgreSQL error:
     - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

Other dependency findings
5. `shared-services/reconciliation-service` is broken, but I found no evidence that payments-api depends on it directly.
   - Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is `CrashLoopBackOff`
   - Events show:
     - `Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 400`
     - `Liveness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 400`
   - The deployment is clearly misconfigured:
     - container image: `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`
     - probes target `port 8443` with `scheme: HTTP`
   - This is a separate issue unless the application architecture expects payments to call it; I did not find evidence of that from the payments deployment.

Conclusion
- Primary cause of failed customer requests: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services/postgres`.
- Most likely triggering component: `shared-services/reporting-service`, which is leaking `idle in transaction` sessions after repeated `division by zero` errors.
- The payments service itself is not crashing; it is returning `503` because it cannot obtain a DB connection.

Fix / mitigation

Immediate, reversible
1. Stop the connection leak source:
   - Scale `shared-services/reporting-service` to 0 or fix/restart it after code correction.
2. Terminate the leaked idle sessions on PostgreSQL if rapid recovery is needed.
3. Optionally increase `max_connections` temporarily if the DB can support it.

Corrective
4. Fix reporting-service so it closes/rolls back DB transactions on error.
5. Review payments-api DB connection handling and add pooling/timeouts if absent.
6. Reassess `max_connections = 20`; it is very low for multiple services sharing one DB.
7. Fix reconciliation-service probe/image configuration separately.

If you want, I can proceed with a safe mitigation now, starting with:
- scaling down `reporting-service`, or
- identifying and terminating only the leaked PostgreSQL sessions.

**Findings**

### 1) Direct cause of the payment failures
`payments/payments-api` is healthy at the pod level but failing every customer request because its database dependency is exhausted.

**Evidence**
- Active alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments`, critical, started `2026-09-29T09:38:11Z`, with **100% error rate**.
- `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is `Running` and `Ready`, so this is not a pod crash/startup issue.
- `payments-api` is configured to use:
  - `PGHOST=postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
  - `PGPORT=5432`
  - `PGDATABASE=demo`
- App logs from `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` show repeated request failures starting at `2026-09-29 09:37:54`:

  `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

  and the API returns `503` on `/api/v1/process-payment`.

**Root cause**
- The PostgreSQL service in `shared-services` has run out of available client connections.

---

### 2) Dependency check in other namespaces

#### A. `shared-services/postgres` — failing dependency
This is the direct dependency of the payment service.

**Evidence**
- Service: `shared-services/postgres` → `172.30.172.15:5432`
- Active alerts:
  1. `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` in `shared-services`, started `2026-09-29T09:36:11Z`
  2. `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` in `shared-services`, critical, started `2026-09-29T09:37:41Z`
- Live DB state from inside `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`:
  - `max_connections = 20`
  - Connection breakdown:
    - `dbuser | 10.128.2.243 | idle in transaction | 16`
    - plus 4 background/internal sessions

This means nearly all usable connections are consumed already.

#### B. `shared-services/reporting-service` — likely source of the connection leak
This service is not in the `payments` namespace, but it is using the same PostgreSQL instance and appears to be exhausting it.

**Evidence**
- Pod: `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`
- Pod IP: `10.128.2.243`
- PostgreSQL shows **16 idle-in-transaction connections from `10.128.2.243`**
- Reporting service logs show a repeating pattern every 10 seconds:
  - `INFO Open db connection`
  - `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`

This strongly indicates `reporting-service` is opening DB sessions and not closing them when the error path is hit, causing a connection leak.

**Conclusion**
- `shared-services/reporting-service` is the most likely reason the shared PostgreSQL instance is exhausted.
- That exhaustion is directly breaking `payments/payments-api`.

#### C. `shared-services/reconciliation-service` — unhealthy, but not the cause of payment failures
**Evidence**
- Pod: `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`
- Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`
- It is running `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`
- Probes are misconfigured/failing:
  - liveness/readiness probe requests `HTTP` to port `8443`
  - logs show repeated probe requests returning `400`
- Current logs do **not** show PostgreSQL usage.

**Conclusion**
- This is a separate problem in `shared-services`.
- It does not appear to be the cause of the payment outage.

---

## Diagnosis

### Root cause
`payments-api` fails because PostgreSQL in `shared-services` has no free connection slots.

### Why PostgreSQL is exhausted
The strongest evidence points to `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` leaking DB connections:
- same DB service
- same timeframe
- repeated app errors
- exact pod IP matches the 16 leaked `idle in transaction` sessions in PostgreSQL

---

## Recommended fix / mitigation

### Immediate mitigation
1. **Restart or scale down `shared-services/reporting-service`** to release leaked connections.  
   - Reversible
   - Fastest way to restore database capacity for `payments-api`

2. If faster recovery is needed, **restart `shared-services/postgres`** only if acceptable for all consumers of that DB.  
   - Reversible
   - More disruptive because it affects all DB clients

### Corrective fix
3. Fix `reporting-service` so failed report processing closes or rolls back DB sessions on error (`division by zero` path).  
   - Reversible via rollout
   - This is the underlying bug causing the leak

4. Consider increasing PostgreSQL connection capacity **only after** fixing the leak.  
   - Reversible
   - Mitigation, not root-cause resolution

---

## Summary
- **Cause of customer-facing payment failures:** `payments-api` cannot connect to `shared-services/postgres` because PostgreSQL connection slots are exhausted.
- **Most likely offender:** `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` leaking DB connections after repeated `division by zero` errors.
- **Other dependency issue found:** `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is crashlooping due to bad probe behavior, but it does not appear to be causing the payment failures.

Findings for `payments` request failures:

## Evidence

### 1) The payment pod is healthy, but every request fails on database connect
- Pod: `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
- Service: `payments/payments-api`
- Endpoint exists: `10.128.2.242:8080`
- Alert firing: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments` with **100%** error rate.

`payments-api` logs show repeated `503` responses caused by PostgreSQL rejecting connections:
- Example timestamps:
  - `2026-09-29 09:37:50,879`
  - `2026-09-29 09:38:34,476`
- Exact error:
  - `connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

The `payments-api` deployment confirms its dependency:
- Deployment: `payments/payments-api`
- DB host: `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
- DB port: `5432`
- DB name: `demo`

### 2) The PostgreSQL dependency is reachable but saturated
- Service: `shared-services/postgres`
- Endpoint exists: `10.128.2.241:5432`
- Pod: `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
- Alerts firing in `shared-services`:
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (`critical`)
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` (`warning`)

Postgres logs show connection exhaustion beginning at:
- `2026-09-29 09:36:36.594 UTC`
- Repeated exact error:
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

### 3) A dependency in another namespace is leaking DB connections
The active/leaked sessions in PostgreSQL are from:
- `client_addr = 10.128.2.243`
- `usename = dbuser`
- `state = idle in transaction`
- Count observed: `16`

That IP belongs to:
- Pod: `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`

Postgres `pg_stat_activity` shows the leaked sessions all came from that pod:
- Transaction start times from `09:34:16` through `09:36:56`
- Repeated query left open:
  - `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`

`reporting-service` logs match that pattern:
- Repeats every ~10s:
  - `INFO Open db connection`
  - `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
- First seen at:
  - `2026-09-29 09:34:16,503`
- This strongly indicates `reporting-service` opens DB connections, hits `division by zero`, and leaves transactions open.

## Root cause

**Primary cause of customer-facing payment failures:**
1. `payments-api` depends on `shared-services/postgres`.
2. PostgreSQL is out of usable connection slots.
3. The saturation is being caused by leaked `idle in transaction` sessions from `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`.
4. As a result, `payments-api` cannot open DB connections and returns `503` for customer requests.

## Other dependency checked

### `shared-services/reconciliation-service`
- Pod: `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`
- Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`
- Service endpoint: **none**
- Liveness/readiness probes are misconfigured:
  - Container serves on `8080`
  - Probes hit `HTTP` on port `8443`
  - Probe failures return `400`

This is a real issue in another namespace, but I found **no evidence** it is causing the payment request failures. `payments-api` only shows a direct dependency on PostgreSQL.

## Recommended fix / mitigation

### Immediate mitigation
1. **Stop the connection leak source**: `shared-services/reporting-service`
   - Fastest reversible mitigation: scale `reporting-service` to `0` or roll back the bad version.
   - Evidence of recent change: deployment is on revision `2`, image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`.

2. **Clear leaked DB sessions**
   - After stopping/rolling back `reporting-service`, terminate the stale PostgreSQL sessions or restart `shared-services/postgres` if session cleanup is not possible operationally.

### Durable fix
1. Fix `reporting-service` so it closes DB connections / rolls back transactions on exceptions.
2. Investigate the `division by zero` bug in `reporting-service:v1.0.2`.
3. Add connection pooling / tighter DB connection limits per app.

### Separate issue
- Fix `shared-services/reconciliation-service` probes to match the actual container port/protocol.

## Bottom line

**Cause of payment outage:** PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services/postgres`, caused by leaked `idle in transaction` sessions from `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`.  
**Not the cause:** `reconciliation-service` is broken too, but there is no evidence it is in the payment request path.

Investigation result: the payment service is failing because its PostgreSQL dependency in `shared-services` is out of connection capacity.

### Evidence

**Payments service itself is up**
- Deployment: `payments/payments-api` — `1/1` available
- Pod: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` — `Running`, `Ready`
- No warning events in `payments`

**Customer requests are failing in the app**
`payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` logs:
- `2026-09-29 09:37:52,195 ERROR Payment failed ... connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- Repeated `503` responses immediately after each DB error

**The alert matches the app symptom**
- `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments` active since `2026-09-29T09:38:11Z`
- Description: `Payment error rate is 100.00%`

### Dependency check in other namespaces

#### 1) Primary failing dependency: `shared-services/postgres`
- Service: `shared-services/postgres` → `172.30.172.15:5432`
- Pod: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` is running, but DB is saturated
- Postgres logs show repeated:
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

**DB metrics**
- `pg_settings_max_connections` = **20**
- `pg_settings_superuser_reserved_connections` = **3**
- Effective non-superuser capacity is therefore **17**
- `pg_stat_database_numbackends{datname="demo"}` = **18**
- `pg_stat_activity_count{usename="dbuser",state="idle in transaction"}` = **16**

**Trend**
- Idle-in-transaction sessions for `dbuser` rose from **3** to **16** over the last 10 minutes
- Total `demo` DB backends rose from **5** to **18** over the same period

There are also active DB alerts:
- `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` in `shared-services`
- `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` in `shared-services`

#### 2) Likely source of the connection leak: `shared-services/reporting-service`
- Deployment: `shared-services/reporting-service`
- Current image: `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`
- Rolled out at about `09:34:15Z`
- Logs from `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`:
  - repeated `INFO Open db connection`
  - immediately followed by `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
  - later transitions to the same Postgres connection-capacity errors

This strongly indicates `reporting-service` is opening DB connections and not cleaning them up when its processing fails. Both `payments-api` and `reporting-service` use `PGUSER=dbuser`, so the leaked sessions from reporting consume the same connection pool class that payments needs.

#### 3) Other dependency in `shared-services`: `reconciliation-service`
- Pod: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`
- Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`
- Cause: bad probes
  - readiness/liveness probing `HTTP /` on port `8443`
  - app returns `400`
- This is unhealthy, but I found no evidence it is causing the payment failures.

---

## Root cause

`payments/payments-api` is healthy, but it cannot process requests because PostgreSQL in `shared-services` has exhausted available non-superuser connections.

The most likely upstream cause is a connection leak introduced or exposed by `shared-services/reporting-service` (`v1.0.2`), which repeatedly opens DB connections, hits `division by zero`, and leaves sessions stuck `idle in transaction`.

---

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Stop the leaking dependency** *(reversible)*
   - Scale `shared-services/reporting-service` to `0` or roll it back from `v1.0.2`
   - This should stop creating new leaked sessions

2. **Free existing leaked DB sessions** *(reversible, but disruptive to those clients)*
   - After stopping the leak, terminate the stuck `dbuser` sessions, or restart the Postgres pod if session cleanup is not practical
   - Without this, payments may continue failing until old sessions clear

3. **Fix `reporting-service`**
   - Ensure DB connections/transactions are closed on exceptions
   - The `division by zero` path appears to leak connections

4. **Secondary cleanup**
   - Fix `shared-services/reconciliation-service` probes; it is unhealthy, though unrelated to the payment outage

If you want, I can apply a mitigation now by scaling `reporting-service` down to `0`.

**Cause of the payment failures**

**Root cause:** `payments/payments-api` is healthy itself, but its direct database dependency `shared-services/postgres` is out of connection capacity because `shared-services/reporting-service` is leaking PostgreSQL sessions.

### Evidence

1. **Customer requests are failing inside the payment pod due to PostgreSQL connection exhaustion**
   - Pod: `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
   - Log lines from `payments-api`:
     - `2026-09-29 09:37:52,061 ERROR Payment failed ... connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
     - Same error repeats on every request and returns `503`.

2. **The payment service is directly dependent on the shared Postgres service in another namespace**
   - Deployment: `payments/payments-api`
   - Environment:
     - `PGHOST=postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
     - `PGPORT=5432`
     - `PGDATABASE=demo`

3. **Active alert matches the symptom**
   - Alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh`
   - Namespace: `payments`
   - Severity: `critical`
   - Description: `Payment error rate is 100.00%`

4. **The database in `shared-services` is saturated**
   - Alert: `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` in `shared-services`
   - Alert: `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` in `shared-services`
   - Prometheus current values:
     - `pg_settings_max_connections = 20`
     - `pg_settings_superuser_reserved_connections = 3`
     - `pg_stat_activity_count` shows **16** sessions for user `dbuser` in state **`idle in transaction`**
     - plus payment traffic trying to connect as user `demo`

5. **Those leaked sessions come from `reporting-service`**
   - PostgreSQL query from the DB pod:
     - `dbuser | 10.128.2.243 | idle in transaction | count 16`
   - Pod IP `10.128.2.243` belongs to:
     - `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`
   - Oldest leaked transaction:
     - `2026-09-29 09:34:16.51253+00`
   - That matches reporting-service startup time.

6. **`reporting-service` logs show repeated DB opens followed by application errors**
   - Pod: `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`
   - Logs:
     - `2026-09-29 09:34:16,503 INFO Starting reporting-service v1.0.2`
     - `2026-09-29 09:34:16,504 INFO Open db connection`
     - `2026-09-29 09:34:16,513 ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
     - Repeats every 10 seconds.
   - This strongly indicates the app opens transactions/connections and does not clean them up on error.

7. **Recent change correlated with onset**
   - Deployment `shared-services/reporting-service` is on **revision 2**
   - Current image: `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`
   - Events show rollout to the new ReplicaSet at `2026-09-29 09:34:15`
   - Connection growth trend over the last 10 minutes:
     - `idle in transaction` sessions for `dbuser`: **3 → 16**

---

## Dependency check in other namespaces

### Direct dependency affecting payments
1. **`shared-services/postgres`**
   - **Impact:** This is the direct cause of payment request failures.
   - Status: pod running, but functionally degraded by exhausted connection slots.

### Other shared-services components
2. **`shared-services/reporting-service`**
   - **Impact:** Indirect but causal. It is consuming/leaking DB connections and starving `payments-api`.
   - Likely source of the outage.

3. **`shared-services/reconciliation-service`**
   - Pod: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`
   - Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`
   - Separate issue:
     - Pod exposes `8080`
     - Liveness/readiness probes are hitting `HTTP` on port `8443`
     - Events: `HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 400`
   - **Not the cause** of the payment request failures based on current evidence, but it is another broken dependency in `shared-services`.

---

## Conclusion

**Payment failures are caused by PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services/postgres`, and the connection exhaustion is being driven by `shared-services/reporting-service` (`v1.0.2`) leaking `idle in transaction` sessions after `division by zero` errors.**

---

## Fix / mitigation

### Fastest mitigation
1. **Scale down or stop `shared-services/reporting-service`** to release pressure on Postgres.  
   - **Reversible**
   - This should allow `payments-api` to acquire DB connections again.

2. **Restart PostgreSQL only if connections do not drain after stopping reporting-service**
   - **Disruptive / reversible**
   - Use only if leaked sessions remain stuck.

### Corrective fix
3. **Rollback `shared-services/reporting-service` from `v1.0.2` to the previous working version**
   - Evidence suggests the issue began immediately after the new rollout.
   - **Reversible**

4. **Fix reporting-service transaction handling**
   - Ensure connections/transactions are closed or rolled back on exceptions, especially on the `division by zero` path.
   - Add connection pooling / limits if not already present.

### Additional unrelated fix
5. **Fix `shared-services/reconciliation-service` probes**
   - Probes are misconfigured against port `8443` while the container exposes `8080`.

If you want, I can proceed with a mitigation now, starting with scaling down `reporting-service`.

> Custom answer correctness: 1.00 - The response is fully correct and aligns very closely with the expected answer. It identifies the correct root cause: `shared-services/reporting-service` is leaking PostgreSQL connections / leaving sessions `idle in transaction`, which exhausts available connection slots on `shared-services/postgres`. It also correctly explains the impact on `payments/payments-api`: the payment service cannot obtain a DB connection and returns `503` for customer requests.

````markdown
**Cause**

`payments/payments-api` is healthy at the pod level but failing requests because its **PostgreSQL dependency in `shared-services` is out of connection capacity**.

### Evidence

1. **Payment service pod is running, but request handling fails in logs**
   - Pod: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
   - Deployment: `payments/payments-api`
   - Log excerpts:
     - `2026-09-29 09:37:50,879 ERROR Payment failed ... FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
     - Repeated `GET /api/v1/process-payment ... 503`
   - The deployment is configured to use:
     - `PGHOST=postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
     - `PGPORT=5432`
     - `PGDATABASE=demo`

2. **There is an active alert on the payment service**
   - Alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh`
   - Namespace: `payments`
   - Severity: `critical`
   - Annotation: `Payment error rate is 100.00%`

3. **The database in another namespace is saturated**
   - Service: `shared-services/postgres`
   - Pod: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
   - Postgres logs:
     - first saturation seen at `2026-09-29 09:36:36.594 UTC`
     - repeated:
       - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
   - Metrics:
     - `pg_settings_max_connections = 20`
     - `pg_settings_superuser_reserved_connections = 3`
     - current `sum(pg_stat_activity_count) = 17`
     - `sum by (datname) (pg_stat_database_numbackends{datname="demo"}) = 18`
   - Connection state:
     - `idle in transaction = 16`
     - `active = 1`

4. **The leaked connections are coming from another pod in `shared-services`**
   - Query inside PostgreSQL showed:
     - `dbuser | 10.128.2.243 | idle in transaction | 16`
   - Pod IP `10.128.2.243` belongs to:
     - `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`

5. **`reporting-service` is repeatedly opening DB connections and erroring**
   - Pod log:
     - `INFO Open db connection`
     - `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
     - repeated every ~10s
     - later also:
       - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
   - This strongly indicates `reporting-service` is opening transactions/connections and not cleaning them up on error.

---

## Root cause

**Primary root cause:**  
`shared-services/reporting-service` is leaking PostgreSQL sessions and leaving them in **`idle in transaction`** state, exhausting available non-superuser connection slots on `shared-services/postgres`.

**Impact on payments:**  
`payments/payments-api` cannot open a DB connection to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`, so customer payment requests return **503**.

---

## Dependency check across namespaces

### Direct dependency affecting payments
1. **`shared-services/postgres`** — **failing capacity-wise**
   - Reachable, running, but connection pool/capacity exhausted.
   - This is the dependency directly causing payment failures.

### Other related dependency findings
2. **`shared-services/reporting-service`** — **misbehaving and likely causing the DB exhaustion**
   - Running pod: `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`
   - Leaking 16 `idle in transaction` DB sessions from IP `10.128.2.243`.

3. **`shared-services/reconciliation-service`** — **unhealthy but not evidenced as the cause of payment failures**
   - Pod: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`
   - Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`
   - Events/logs show probe misconfiguration:
     - liveness/readiness probing `HTTP /` on port `8443`
     - responses are `400`
   - This is a separate issue unless payments also depend on it, which is **not shown** in the `payments-api` deployment config.

---

## Fix / mitigation

### Fastest reversible mitigation
1. **Stop the connection leak source**
   - Scale `shared-services/reporting-service` to `0` temporarily, or restart it after disabling the faulty code path.
   - This should free DB capacity for `payments-api`.

### Correct fix
2. **Fix `reporting-service` transaction handling**
   - Ensure DB connections/transactions are closed or rolled back on exceptions.
   - The repeating `division by zero` error is the likely trigger path.

### Hardening
3. **Add connection pooling or stricter limits**
   - Use pgbouncer or application-side pooling.
   - Consider `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` to kill leaked sessions automatically.

### Secondary issue
4. **Fix `reconciliation-service` probes**
   - Current container is `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`
   - Deployment exposes `containerPort: 8080`
   - Probes are hitting `port: 8443` with `scheme: HTTP`, returning `400`
   - This should be corrected, but it is not the cause of the payment outage.

---

## Bottom line

**Payment failures are caused by exhausted PostgreSQL connections in `shared-services/postgres`, and the connection exhaustion is being driven by `shared-services/reporting-service` leaking `idle in transaction` sessions.** The `reconciliation-service` is also broken, but it is a separate issue based on current evidence.

## Diagnosis

**Root cause: PostgreSQL in `shared-services` has exhausted its client connection slots.**

Evidence:

- Alertmanager reports:
  - `payments/PaymentErrorRateHigh` at **100% error rate**, critical.
  - `shared-services/PostgresqlTooManyConnections`: **18 active connections**.
  - `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is in `CrashLoopBackOff`.
- `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is running and ready, but its logs show every payment request returning **503**:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- The payment API connects to:
  - Host: `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
  - Port: `5432`
  - Database: `demo`
- PostgreSQL logs contain repeated identical connection failures beginning at least at `09:37:12 UTC`.

The payment service itself is not crashing; it is failing because its database dependency cannot accept its connections.

## Dependency status

| Dependency | Namespace | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `postgres` | `shared-services` | Running, `2/2` ready | Database process is up but connection capacity is exhausted |
| `reconciliation-service` | `shared-services` | `0/1`, `CrashLoopBackOff` | Wrong/incompatible workload: running `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`; probes receive HTTP 400 and restart it |
| `reporting-service` | `shared-services` | Running, `1/1` ready | Recently rolled to image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`; likely another database client |
| `postgres` Service | `shared-services` | Present | ClusterIP `172.30.172.15:5432`; DNS and service routing are working because PostgreSQL returns an application-level FATAL error |

## Likely contributing cause

The database connection exhaustion is likely caused by one or more clients opening too many connections or failing to release them. The strongest suspicious dependency is:

`shared-services/reconciliation-service`

It is repeatedly restarting due to failed probes and is configured with an HTTP Apache image rather than an apparent reconciliation-service image. Its current workload does not look like a valid implementation of the declared service. However, the available evidence does **not** prove that it is the component consuming all PostgreSQL connections.

The `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` alert reports **18 active connections**, while the PostgreSQL client logs show the non-superuser connection limit has already been reached.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediately reduce database connection pressure**
   - Stop or scale down `shared-services/reconciliation-service` while it is misconfigured and crashing.
   - Inspect and correct its deployment image and probe configuration before restoring it.
   - Review connection pool sizes and cleanup behavior in `payments-api` and `reporting-service`.

2. **Recover PostgreSQL capacity**
   - Terminating leaked client connections or restarting the PostgreSQL pod may restore service, but a PostgreSQL restart is disruptive and should be treated as a temporary mitigation.
   - First identify which application roles/processes own the active connections, if administrative database access is available.

3. **Fix the reconciliation deployment**
   - It currently runs `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`.
   - Its probes target port `8443`, while the container declares port `8080`.
   - Kubernetes events show repeated probe failures with HTTP status `400`, followed by restarts.

4. **Verify recovery**
   - Confirm PostgreSQL no longer reports reserved connection slots.
   - Confirm new requests to `payments-api` stop returning HTTP 503.
   - Check that `PaymentErrorRateHigh` clears and that all required shared-services deployments have available replicas.

No evidence currently indicates a network, DNS, service-discovery, node, or image-pull failure.

## Diagnosis

### Root cause — PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`

The payment service itself is running, but all customer requests fail because its PostgreSQL dependency has no connection slots available.

**Evidence:**

- AlertManager reports:
  - `payments/PaymentErrorRateHigh` — **100% error rate**, critical.
  - `shared-services/PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — **18 active connections**.
- Pod `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is `Running` and `Ready`, but its logs show repeated HTTP 503 responses:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- The failing dependency is:
  - Service: `shared-services/postgres`
  - DNS: `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
  - Cluster IP: `172.30.172.15`
  - Backend pod: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
- PostgreSQL has `max_connections = 20`.
- Current activity contains:
  - **16 `dbuser` connections in `idle in transaction`**
  - All originate from `10.128.2.243`, the pod IP of `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`.
  - Each has been holding a transaction since startup and ran:
    > `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`

This identifies `reporting-service` as the connection leak/exhaustion source. Its connections consume nearly all PostgreSQL capacity, preventing `payments-api` from authenticating.

### Dependency status

| Dependency | Namespace | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---:|---|
| PostgreSQL | `shared-services` | Running, `2/2` ready | Reachable, but connection pool exhausted |
| Reporting service | `shared-services` | Running, `1/1` ready | Holding 16 idle-in-transaction DB sessions from `10.128.2.243` |
| Reconciliation service | `shared-services` | `CrashLoopBackOff`, `0/1` ready | Separate dependency issue; service uses the wrong image/probe combination |
| Payment API | `payments` | Running, `1/1` ready | Application process is healthy but returns 503 on every DB-backed request |

### Additional dependency issue

`shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is crash looping because it runs:

```text
registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest
```

Its probes request `/` on port `8443`, while the deployment declares container port `8080`. Events show repeated probe failures with HTTP `400`, followed by container restarts. Its Service currently has **no endpoints**.

This is not the direct cause of the payment 503s—the payment logs consistently point to PostgreSQL connection exhaustion—but it is an additional unhealthy dependency in the payment-processing system.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediate, reversible:** restart `shared-services/reporting-service` to release its 16 stuck PostgreSQL sessions. Confirm PostgreSQL connection usage drops and payment requests recover.
2. **Permanent fix:** correct the reporting service’s database transaction handling:
   - close or commit/rollback each transaction;
   - use a bounded connection pool;
   - avoid leaving read-only queries in `idle in transaction`;
   - configure idle-in-transaction timeouts as a safety measure.
3. **PostgreSQL protection:** review connection limits and reserve capacity for critical services. Increasing `max_connections` alone is only a temporary mitigation unless the reporting leak is fixed.
4. **Separate remediation:** replace the `reconciliation-service` placeholder Apache image with its intended service image and correct its probes/ports. Do not treat restarting it as a fix for the database exhaustion.

## Diagnosis

**Root cause:** The payment API cannot obtain PostgreSQL connections because the database has exhausted its available connection slots.

### Evidence

- Active critical alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments`, reporting a **100% payment error rate**.
- Pod `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is `Running` and `Ready`, but its logs show repeated HTTP `503` responses:
  - `connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" ... failed`
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- The dependency is PostgreSQL in another namespace:
  - Service: `shared-services/postgres`
  - Cluster IP: `172.30.172.15`
  - Endpoint: `10.128.2.241:5432`
  - Pod: `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
- PostgreSQL logs confirm the same failure:
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- Alertmanager also reports:
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — **18 active connections**
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh`
- The PostgreSQL pod is otherwise `2/2 Running`, and its service has a valid endpoint, so this is not a DNS, service routing, or pod availability failure.

## Dependency assessment

| Dependency | Namespace | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---:|---|
| PostgreSQL | `shared-services` | Running | **Degraded**: connection slots exhausted |
| Reconciliation service | `shared-services` | `CrashLoopBackOff` | Failed HTTP readiness/liveness probes with status `400`; likely an additional dependency issue, but not the direct cause shown in payment logs |
| Reporting service | `shared-services` | `1/1 Running` | No current pod-level failure observed |
| Payment API | `payments` | `1/1 Running` | Process is healthy at pod level but all database-backed requests return `503` |

The PostgreSQL service itself is reachable and correctly resolves across namespaces. The failure is capacity/resource exhaustion at the database connection layer.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediately inspect and clear the connection leak or excessive clients** in PostgreSQL, prioritizing the clients using the most connections.
2. Restarting the `payments-api` pod may temporarily release its connections, but this is only a short-term mitigation and may worsen request disruption.
3. Review connection pooling and ensure the payment service has a bounded pool with proper connection reuse and timeout handling.
4. Investigate `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` separately. It is repeatedly restarted because its probes receive `400`, and it may be contributing to database connection pressure if it connects to PostgreSQL.
5. Increase PostgreSQL connection capacity only after confirming memory/resource headroom; otherwise this can destabilize the database.

The primary customer-impacting cause is **PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`**, not a failure of the payment pod or Kubernetes service networking.

## Diagnosis

### Evidence

- **Payment API:** `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
  - Pod is `Running`, `Ready`, with zero restarts.
  - Deployment `payments-api` is `1/1` available.
  - Despite this, the active alert `PaymentErrorRateHigh` reports a **100% payment error rate**.
- Payment logs repeatedly show:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

  The API consequently returns HTTP **503** for customer requests.
- The API is configured to use:
  - Host: `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
  - Port: `5432`
  - Database: `demo`
- PostgreSQL is reachable through Service `shared-services/postgres` at `172.30.172.15`, but its connection capacity is exhausted.
- PostgreSQL logs contain continuous:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- Alertmanager has both:
  - `shared-services/PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — **critical**
  - `shared-services/PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` — warning, reporting 18 connections

### Root cause

The customer request failures are caused by **PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in the `shared-services` namespace**, not by a failed or unready payment API pod.

The payment service cannot obtain a non-superuser database connection, so it returns 503 responses.

## Dependency assessment

### `shared-services/postgres` — **Critical**

- Deployment: `postgres`
- Pod: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
- Status: `2/2 Running`
- Service: `postgres`
- Database logs confirm exhausted connection slots.
- This is the direct dependency failure affecting payments.

### `shared-services/reporting-service` — **Degraded and likely contributing**

- Pod: `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`
- Status: `Running`, but logs show it opens a database connection every 10 seconds:
  > `INFO Open db connection`
- It repeatedly fails with:
  > `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
- It also intermittently receives the same PostgreSQL connection exhaustion error.

This service is a likely contributor to connection pressure, particularly because it repeatedly opens connections while its processing logic is failing. The logs do not conclusively prove that it is leaking connections, but it should be investigated or temporarily isolated.

### `shared-services/reconciliation-service` — **Unavailable, separate issue**

- Pod: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`
- Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`, `0/1` ready
- It uses the `rhel9/httpd-24` image with probes targeting `/` on port `8443`, while the container declares port `8080`.
- Events show repeated HTTP probe failures with status `400`, followed by container restarts.

This service is unhealthy, but the payment logs identify PostgreSQL connection exhaustion as the cause of payment failures. Its failure is not shown as the direct cause of the customer request errors.

### `shared-services/reporting-service` — Available but functionally failing

The current pod is ready, but repeated `division by zero` errors indicate that readiness does not represent functional health.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediately reduce PostgreSQL connection pressure**
   - Temporarily scale down or stop `shared-services/reporting-service` if it is not required for customer payment processing.
   - Verify whether active PostgreSQL connections drop and payment 503s stop.
   - This is reversible.

2. **Check and correct connection handling**
   - Ensure the payment, reporting, and other database clients close connections or use bounded connection pools.
   - Add explicit pool limits and connection timeouts.
   - Fix the reporting service’s `division by zero` failure so it does not repeatedly retry failed work.

3. **Increase PostgreSQL capacity only after identifying consumers**
   - Raising `max_connections` may provide temporary relief, but without fixing connection consumption it can exhaust database memory or recur.
   - If required, use a connection pooler or tune application pool sizes.

4. **Correct `reconciliation-service` separately**
   - Its probes target the wrong endpoint/port for the deployed Apache image.
   - Align the service container port and health probes, or deploy the intended reconciliation-service image.

No cluster changes were made during this investigation.

````markdown
## Diagnosis

**Customer impact:** `payments/payments-api` is returning HTTP 503 for payment requests, with the alert `PaymentErrorRateHigh` reporting a **100% error rate**.

### Root cause

The payment API cannot obtain a PostgreSQL connection:

```text
connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15),
port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

Evidence:

- `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is Running and Ready, but its logs show repeated payment failures and HTTP 503 responses.
- The database is `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`.
- PostgreSQL has `max_connections = 20`.
- Current activity shows **16 `idle in transaction` connections from `10.128.2.243`**, which is the pod IP of `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`.
- PostgreSQL logs repeatedly report connection-slot exhaustion.
- Alertmanager is firing:
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — 18 active connections
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh`
  - `PaymentErrorRateHigh` — critical

This identifies `reporting-service` as the primary connection leak/exhaustion source. Its logs repeatedly show:

```text
Open db connection
ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
```

It also intermittently fails to connect because the database is already exhausted.

## Dependency assessment

| Dependency | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| `shared-services/postgres` | Running, but unhealthy for clients | Connection limit exhausted; 16 idle-in-transaction connections are attributed to reporting-service |
| `shared-services/reporting-service` | Running/Ready | Functionally failing with repeated `division by zero`; appears to leave database transactions/connections open |
| `shared-services/reconciliation-service` | **Unhealthy** | `0/1`, CrashLoopBackOff; uses the wrong image (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`) and its probes receive HTTP 400 |
| `payments/payments-api` | Running/Ready | Application process is healthy, but all database-backed payment requests fail with 503 |
| `shared-services/postgres` Service | Present | `172.30.172.15:5432`; DNS and service routing are working—the failure is database capacity, not network reachability |

## Additional issue

`shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is independently broken:

- Image: `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`
- Readiness/liveness probes target `/` on port `8443`
- Apache returns HTTP 400
- Pod is in CrashLoopBackOff

This is not the direct cause of the payment failures based on the payment API logs, but it is another failed dependency in the payment-processor stack and should be corrected.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediately stop or restart `shared-services/reporting-service`** to release its 16 idle transactions. This is reversible, but may interrupt report processing.
2. Verify PostgreSQL connection utilization returns below the limit and retry payment requests.
3. Fix `reporting-service` so every database connection/transaction is closed on both success and exception paths, particularly the `division by zero` path. Add connection pooling and pool-size limits.
4. Correct the `reconciliation-service` Deployment image, container port, and health probes. Do not simply disable the probes; the current container is not the intended reconciliation application.
5. Avoid treating `payments-api` readiness as sufficient: it reports Ready while its database dependency is unavailable. Add a dependency-aware health check or connection-pool safeguards.

## Diagnosis

**Root cause:** the payment service cannot obtain PostgreSQL connections because the shared database has exhausted its available connection slots.

### Evidence

- Alertmanager reports:
  - `PaymentErrorRateHigh` — **100% payment error rate**, critical, in `payments`.
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — **18 active connections**, critical, in `shared-services`.
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` — active in `shared-services`.
- `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is Running and Ready, but its logs show repeated failures:
  ```text
  connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local"
  (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed:
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```
  Each request returns HTTP **503**.
- PostgreSQL pod `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` is Running, and the Service has the expected endpoint:
  - `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`
  - Endpoint: `10.128.2.241:5432`
- PostgreSQL logs confirm the resource exhaustion, with repeated:
  ```text
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```

This is therefore **not a payments pod scheduling, DNS, Service, or network reachability failure**. The payment pod reaches PostgreSQL, but PostgreSQL rejects normal-user connections because its connection capacity is full.

   - Restart the connection-leaking workload only if necessary; this is disruptive and should be treated as a reversible mitigation.
   - Avoid restarting PostgreSQL first unless required, because that disrupts all database users.

2. **Investigate connection pooling/leaks**
   - The payment deployment has no resource limits or visible pool controls.
   - Review the payment and reporting clients for connections that are opened per request and not returned/closed.
   - Add a bounded connection pool and timeouts.

3. **Repair `shared-services/reconciliation-service`**
   - Its Service currently has no endpoints because the only pod is in `CrashLoopBackOff`.
   - Correct the workload image/probe configuration. The current HTTP probe targets `/` on port `8443`, while the container declares port `8080`; events show the probe receives HTTP 400.
   - This is a separate availability issue, but it may also contribute to database pressure if it is repeatedly creating connections before failing.

4. **Capacity/configuration follow-up**
   - Review PostgreSQL `max_connections` and reserve capacity only after fixing connection leaks/pooling. Raising the limit alone may defer rather than resolve the failure.

The immediate customer-impacting failure is the exhausted PostgreSQL connection pool in `shared-services`; the payment deployment itself is healthy at the Kubernetes readiness level but returns 503 for every payment request.

## Diagnosis

**Root cause:** PostgreSQL in `shared-services` has exhausted its connection limit, causing the payment API to return HTTP 503 for all customer requests.

### Evidence

- Alertmanager reports `payments/PaymentErrorRateHigh` at **100% error rate** beginning **09:37:58**.
- `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is Running and Ready, but its logs repeatedly show:

  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

  followed by:

  > `GET /api/v1/process-payment ... 503`

- The payment service connects to:

  `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`, database `demo`.

- PostgreSQL pod `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` is Running and its Service has a valid endpoint, so this is not a DNS, Service, or pod-availability failure.
- PostgreSQL reports:
  - `max_connections = 20`
  - **16 connections** from `10.128.2.243`
  - All 16 are `idle in transaction`
  - `10.128.2.243` is the `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` pod.
- PostgreSQL logs show the connection failures starting at **09:36:36 UTC**, continuing throughout the payment failures.

This identifies `reporting-service` as the immediate source of the connection exhaustion: it has 16 connections left open in `idle in transaction` state, leaving too few slots for `payments-api`.

## Dependency status

| Dependency | Namespace | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `postgres` Deployment | `shared-services` | 1/1 Ready | Process is healthy, but connection capacity is exhausted |
| `postgres` Service | `shared-services` | Endpoint present | Resolves to `10.128.2.241:5432` |
| `reporting-service` | `shared-services` | 1/1 Ready | Holds 16 leaked/long-lived `idle in transaction` database sessions from `10.128.2.243` |
| `reconciliation-service` | `shared-services` | 0/1, CrashLoopBackOff | Separate dependency issue; its logs show Apache serving HTTP 400 responses because probes target port 8443 while the container exposes 8080. It is not the direct cause of the payment 503s. |
| `payments-api` Service | `payments` | Endpoint present | Routes to `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` |
| `payments-api` Deployment | `payments` | 1/1 Ready | Application is alive but cannot acquire PostgreSQL connections |

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediate, reversible:** restart or roll out `reporting-service` to release its 16 stuck database sessions. This should restore PostgreSQL capacity, but it may recur if the application continues leaving transactions open.
2. **Permanent fix:** correct `reporting-service` transaction/connection handling:
   - Ensure every transaction is committed or rolled back.
   - Close or return connections to the pool.
   - Configure a bounded pool size below the PostgreSQL limit.
   - Add idle-transaction timeouts or monitoring.
3. **Protect the database:** increase `max_connections` only after reviewing memory capacity and pool sizing; increasing it alone would mask the connection leak.
4. Separately fix `shared-services/reconciliation-service` probes or container port configuration. Its deployment is unhealthy, but current evidence does not show it causing the payment failures.

No change was made to the cluster.

## Diagnosis

**Root cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`, causing the payment API to return 503s.**

### Evidence

- Active alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments` reports **100% payment errors**.
- `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is `Running` and `Ready`, but its logs show repeated failures beginning at **09:37:48 UTC**:

  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

- The payment service is configured to use:

  `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`, database `demo`.

- PostgreSQL pod `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` is running, but its logs contain a sustained stream of the same fatal connection-slot errors from **09:36:36 UTC onward**.
- The `shared-services` alert confirms the database is saturated:
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh`: **18 connections**
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections`: **18 active connections**

Therefore, networking and DNS are functioning—the payment service resolves PostgreSQL to `172.30.172.15`—but PostgreSQL rejects normal application users because all non-superuser connection slots are consumed.

## Dependency status

| Dependency | Namespace | Status | Findings |
|---|---|---:|---|
| PostgreSQL | `shared-services` | Degraded | Pod is `2/2 Running`, but connection slots are exhausted. This is the direct cause of payment failures. |
| Reporting service | `shared-services` | Running but unhealthy | `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` is `1/1 Running`, but logs repeatedly report `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`; it also intermittently fails to connect to PostgreSQL due to the connection exhaustion. |
| Reconciliation service | `shared-services` | **Unavailable** | `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is in `CrashLoopBackOff` with 6 restarts. It uses the wrong workload image (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`) and its probes target HTTPS port `8443` while the container declares port `8080`; probes receive HTTP 400 and restart the container. |
| `payments-api` Service | `payments` | Present | ClusterIP `172.30.89.197`, ports `8080/8081`; the API pod itself is ready. |

## Recommended remediation

1. **Immediately reduce or terminate excess PostgreSQL client connections** from the affected services, then verify that payment requests recover.
2. **Investigate connection pooling/leaks** in `payments-api`, `reporting-service`, and any other clients using `shared-services/postgres`. The repeated connection attempts and the 18-connection alerts indicate that the database’s configured capacity is too small for the current workload or clients are not releasing connections.
3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` separately**:
   - Deploy its intended reconciliation image rather than `rhel9/httpd-24:latest`.
   - Correct its readiness/liveness probe protocol and port.
   - This is not the direct cause of the payment 503s, but it is an unhealthy dependency in the payment-processor group and may contribute to database usage if replaced with the intended application.
4. **Fix the reporting-service application error** (`division by zero`) and ensure it uses a bounded connection pool with proper connection closing.

I did not restart or modify workloads because terminating connections or changing PostgreSQL capacity without identifying the offending clients could cause data-processing interruption.

````markdown
## Diagnosis

**Payment requests are failing because the PostgreSQL dependency in `shared-services` has exhausted its available connection slots.**

### Evidence

- Active alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` in `payments`, critical severity, reporting **100% error rate**.
- `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is `Running` and Ready, so the payment pod itself is scheduled and healthy at the Kubernetes level.
- Payment logs repeatedly show:

```text
connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local"
(172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed:
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

- Requests consequently return HTTP `503`.
- PostgreSQL logs in `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` show the same connection-exhaustion error beginning at `09:36:36 UTC`.
- Active alert in the dependency namespace:
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — critical
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` — warning
  - Reports **18 active connections**

### Dependency status

| Dependency | Namespace | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `postgres` | `shared-services` | Running, 2/2 containers Ready | Reachable, but connection capacity is exhausted |
| `reconciliation-service` | `shared-services` | `CrashLoopBackOff`, 0/1 Ready | Independently unhealthy |
| `reporting-service` | `shared-services` | Running, 1/1 Ready | No Kubernetes-level issue observed |

The payment service is configured to use:

```text
postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432
database=demo
```

The PostgreSQL Service resolves to `172.30.172.15`, and the payment logs confirm it is reaching that endpoint. This is therefore **not a DNS, Service, or network-connectivity failure**; PostgreSQL is rejecting new non-superuser connections because its connection limit has been reached.

## Additional dependency issue

`shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is also failing:

- Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`
- Restarts: 6
- Deployment `shared-services/reconciliation-service`: `0/1` available
- It uses `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`, but its probes target `/` on port `8443` using HTTP.
- The container logs show HTTP `400` responses to the probes, followed by liveness-probe restarts.

This appears to be a separate configuration/probe failure, but it may contribute to database connection pressure if the service repeatedly opens connections during startup or processing. The available evidence does not prove that it is the source of all 18 PostgreSQL connections.

## Root cause

**Primary:** PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services/postgres`.

**Secondary:** Misconfigured `reconciliation-service` probes are causing repeated restarts and may be contributing to connection churn.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Restore database capacity first**
   - Identify and terminate leaked or idle application connections.
   - Review PostgreSQL `max_connections` and the connection limits for the payment and shared-services users.
   - Prefer correcting application connection pooling/leak behavior rather than only increasing `max_connections`.
   - Restarting affected client workloads may temporarily release leaked connections, but this is only a reversible mitigation and could interrupt processing.

2. **Fix `reconciliation-service`**
   - Align the probe with the actual container listener and protocol.
   - The deployment declares container port `8080`, while probes check port `8443`; the logs also show HTTP requests receiving `400`.
   - Do not leave the deployment in its current CrashLoopBackOff state, since repeated restarts can worsen dependency pressure.

3. **After remediation**
   - Confirm PostgreSQL accepts normal application connections.
   - Verify `payments-api` logs no longer contain the reserved-slot error and that requests stop returning `503`.
   - Confirm `reconciliation-service` reaches `1/1` Ready.

## Diagnosis

**Customer payment failures are caused by PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`, not by the payment pod or network connectivity.**

### Evidence

- AlertManager reports:
  - `PaymentErrorRateHigh` — **100% payment error rate**, critical, namespace `payments`.
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — **18 active connections**, critical, namespace `shared-services`.
  - `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping` — `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`.
- Payment pod `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is `Running` and `Ready`, but its logs repeatedly show:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

  Every affected request returns HTTP **503**.
- The payment deployment connects to:
  - Host: `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`
  - Port: `5432`
  - Database: `demo`
- PostgreSQL itself is running and its Service has a valid endpoint:
  - Pod: `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
  - Service: `shared-services/postgres`
  - Cluster IP: `172.30.172.15`
  - Pod status: `2/2 Running`

This rules out a basic DNS, Service, scheduling, or PostgreSQL process outage. The failure is specifically database connection capacity exhaustion.

## Dependency findings

### 1. PostgreSQL — direct dependency — degraded

`shared-services/postgres` is available, but has exhausted connection slots. AlertManager recorded **18 active connections** and the database rejects normal application users while preserving reserved superuser slots.

### 2. Reporting service — likely contributor

`shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` is Ready, but its logs show a repeating failure every 10 seconds:

> `Open db connection`  
> `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`

It repeatedly opens database connections while processing fails. This is consistent with a connection leak or insufficient connection cleanup and is the strongest observed contributor to PostgreSQL exhaustion.

### 3. Reconciliation service — unhealthy and potentially contributing

`shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is in `CrashLoopBackOff` and has zero available replicas. Its probes fail with HTTP **400** because the deployment runs:

- Image: `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`
- Probe path: `/`
- Probe port: `8443`

The container logs confirm Apache returns HTTP 400 for the probe requests. This service is misconfigured and unavailable. Its logs also show database connection failures, although the available evidence does not prove that it is the primary source of the connection leak.

## Root cause

**PostgreSQL connection slots are exhausted, most likely due to faulty database-connection handling in `reporting-service`, compounded by the unhealthy `reconciliation-service`.** The payment service then receives PostgreSQL “remaining connection slots” errors and returns 503 responses.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediately stop or restart the connection-leaking workload**, prioritizing:
   - `shared-services/reporting-service`
   - Then assess/restart `shared-services/reconciliation-service` if it continues opening connections.

   This is reversible but may interrupt report/reconciliation processing.

2. **Fix the reporting service** so every database connection is closed or returned to a bounded pool even when `division by zero` occurs.

3. **Correct the reconciliation deployment**:
   - Use the intended reconciliation-service image rather than the generic Apache image.
   - Align its readiness/liveness probes with the actual application port and health endpoint.
   - Do not use `/` on port `8443` unless that is the service’s intended health endpoint.

4. **Recover PostgreSQL capacity** after stopping the source of excess connections. Restarting PostgreSQL alone may temporarily restore payments but will not resolve the underlying leak.

5. Add connection pooling and per-service connection limits so reporting or reconciliation cannot consume all PostgreSQL slots needed by `payments-api`.

## Root cause — PostgreSQL connection exhaustion

`payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is healthy at the pod/service layer, but every payment request fails when it opens a database connection.

- `PaymentErrorRateHigh` is **critical**: **100%** errors.
- Payment API logs repeatedly show HTTP **503** responses, for example at `2026-09-29 09:37:58 UTC`:
  ```text
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```
  against `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`.

### Dependency status

| Dependency | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `payments/payments-api` Route, Service, EndpointSlice | Healthy | Route targets Service `payments-api`; EndpointSlice contains ready endpoint `10.128.2.242:8080`. |
| `shared-services/postgres` | Running/reachable, but saturated | Pod `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` is `2/2 Running`; Service resolves to `172.30.172.15` and has endpoint `10.128.2.241:5432`. |
| `shared-services/reporting-service` | **Cause of saturation** | `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` (`10.128.2.243`) leaks DB sessions after errors. |
| `shared-services/reconciliation-service` | Broken but not evidenced as a payments dependency | `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is `CrashLoopBackOff`; its HTTP probes call port `8443` and receive HTTP `400`. |

## Causal chain

1. PostgreSQL is explicitly configured with `max_connections = 20` in ConfigMap `shared-services/postgres-init`.
2. PostgreSQL currently has **16 `dbuser` sessions in `idle in transaction`**, all from `10.128.2.243`, the IP of `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`.
3. Each leaked session is running `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`; the first began at `2026-09-29 09:34:16 UTC`.
4. Reporting-service logs show a 10-second loop: `Open db connection` followed by `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`. The error path does not close/roll back the connection.
5. Once usable PostgreSQL connections were exhausted, PostgreSQL began refusing ordinary users at `2026-09-29 09:36:36 UTC`. Payments requests then consistently returned `503`.

The recent reporting-service rollout is a likely regression point: Deployment `shared-services/reporting-service` is revision **2** and currently runs image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`; the prior revision used `v1.0.1`.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediately stop the leaking reporting service** — scale `shared-services/reporting-service` to zero. This is reversible and closes its leaked backend connections, restoring capacity for payment traffic.
2. If connections do not clear promptly, terminate the stale `idle in transaction` PostgreSQL sessions from `10.128.2.243` (operationally disruptive only to reporting-service).
3. **Roll back reporting-service to `v1.0.1`** or fix `v1.0.2` so that the division-by-zero path rolls back/closes connections. Add connection pooling and an `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`.
4. Reassess PostgreSQL capacity afterward; its configured limit of 20, with 3 superuser-reserved slots, leaves little headroom even after the leak is fixed.

No NetworkPolicies exist in either `payments` or `shared-services`, and DNS/service connectivity to PostgreSQL is working; this is not a network or Route failure.

## Root cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`

`payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is healthy at the pod/service level (Ready, endpoint `10.128.2.242`), but every payment request fails with HTTP **503** because it cannot open a PostgreSQL connection.

**Evidence**
- `PaymentErrorRateHigh` critical alert reports a **100%** payment error rate.
- Payment API logs repeatedly show:
  ```text
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```
  For example, at `09:38:24.637`, transaction `515677` returned `503`.
- Its configured dependency is `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`, and `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` is reachable/Ready with a valid Service endpoint at `172.30.172.15:5432`.
- PostgreSQL is configured with only **20** maximum connections (`shared-services/postgres-init` sets `max_connections = 20`).
- Current database usage is **18 connections**: **16** are `idle in transaction`; PostgreSQL therefore rejects ordinary application connections while preserving its reserved superuser slots.

## Causing dependency: `shared-services/reporting-service`

`shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` is leaking database connections.

**Evidence**
- Its `reporting_active_connections` rose from **1 to 16** in the last 10 minutes.
- It logs a new `Open db connection` every 10 seconds, followed by:
  ```text
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
- The connections remain open: PostgreSQL reports **16 `idle in transaction`** connections.
- Overall PostgreSQL connections rose from **5 to 18** during the same period.
- This aligns with the first PostgreSQL exhaustion error at `09:36:36.594` and the payment alert beginning at `09:37:58`.

The report-processing error path is not closing/rolling back its database connection, exhausting the shared database and preventing payment processing.

## Other dependency status

1. **PostgreSQL** — available and serving, but saturated  
   - `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`: `2/2 Running`
   - Service has a ready endpoint.
   - This is the direct dependency causing payments to fail.

2. **Reporting service** — Running but functionally faulty  
   - `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`: `1/1 Running`
   - Its health state masks the `division by zero` application failure and connection leak.

3. **Reconciliation service** — separately unhealthy, not evidenced as the payment failure cause  
   - `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`: `CrashLoopBackOff`, `0/1 Ready`.
   - It has no ready endpoint.
   - Its liveness/readiness probes use **HTTP** against port `8443`, but the RHEL httpd image expects TLS there; probes receive HTTP `400`, triggering restarts. The service declares port `8080`, creating an additional configuration mismatch.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediately stop or scale down `shared-services/reporting-service`** to prevent further leaked connections. This is reversible and will release its connections when the pod terminates.
2. **Restart PostgreSQL only if connections do not clear after stopping reporting**. This is disruptive: all database clients reconnect and in-flight transactions are interrupted.
3. **Fix `reporting-service`**: handle the division-by-zero input and guarantee transaction rollback/connection close on every exception; preferably use bounded connection pooling.
4. **Increase PostgreSQL connection capacity only as a temporary safeguard** after establishing application-side limits/pooling. Raising `max_connections` alone does not fix the leak.
5. **Fix reconciliation probes** to use the correct scheme/port (likely HTTPS on `8443`, or configure the service and probes consistently).

## Cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`

`payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is healthy at the pod and Service levels (Ready, endpoint `10.128.2.242`), but every payment request fails when it opens a database connection:

```text
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

The application returns **HTTP 503** as a result. The active `PaymentErrorRateHigh` critical alert reports **100% error rate**.

### Database evidence

The payment API uses:

- Host: `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`
- Service: `shared-services/postgres` → endpoint `10.128.2.241`

PostgreSQL is reachable and its pod is Ready, but its capacity is exhausted:

| Setting / state | Value |
|---|---:|
| `max_connections` | 20 |
| Reserved superuser slots | 3 |
| `dbuser` sessions from `10.128.2.243` | 16, all `idle in transaction` |

The database was explicitly configured with the very low `max_connections = 20` in `shared-services/postgres-init`.

## Root cause

`shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` (`v1.0.2`, IP `10.128.2.243`) is leaking database connections.

Evidence:

- PostgreSQL shows **16** `dbuser` sessions from that exact pod IP, all **idle in transaction**, with the oldest from `09:34:16 UTC`.
- Its logs repeatedly show `Open db connection`, followed by `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`.
- The service appears to open a connection every 10 seconds and does not release it when the report-processing error occurs.
- Once the non-superuser capacity is consumed, the payment API cannot open a connection and returns 503.

## Dependency status in `shared-services`

1. **PostgreSQL — degraded by connection exhaustion**
   - `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`: `2/2 Running`
   - Service endpoint is present and reachable.
   - This is the direct dependency causing the payment outage.

2. **Reporting service — root source of leaked connections**
   - `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`: `1/1 Running`
   - Deployment revision 2 uses image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`.
   - It has a recurring `division by zero` processing failure and leaked 16 DB transactions.

3. **Reconciliation service — independently broken, not evidenced as the payment failure**
   - `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`: `CrashLoopBackOff`, 6 restarts.
   - Its readiness and liveness probes issue **HTTP** requests to port **8443**, while the container runs HTTPS there; the probes receive HTTP 400.
   - This service has no database configuration and is not in the payment API’s observed dependency path.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediately, reversible:** scale `shared-services/reporting-service` to `0` or otherwise stop it. This should close its leaked sessions and restore database capacity for payments. It pauses reporting only.
2. Terminate existing leaked `dbuser` sessions if they do not close promptly after stopping reporting.
3. Fix or roll back `reporting-service:v1.0.2`:
   - correct the `division by zero` path;
   - ensure connections and transactions are closed/rolled back in failure handling;
   - set a bounded connection pool.
4. Review `max_connections = 20`; increase it only after fixing the leak and validating PostgreSQL resource capacity.
5. Separately correct reconciliation probes to use `HTTPS` on port `8443` (or point them at the actual HTTP listener).

## Cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`

`payments/payments-api` is reachable and Ready (`payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`, Service endpoint `10.128.2.242:8080`), but every payment request fails with HTTP **503** because it cannot open a PostgreSQL connection.

**Evidence**
- `PaymentErrorRateHigh` is firing at **100%** error rate.
- Payment API logs repeatedly show:
  ```text
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```
  Example: transaction `570705` at `09:38:20` returned `503`.
- The API is configured to use:
  ```text
  postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432 / database demo
  ```
- PostgreSQL (`shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`) is healthy and has a ready Service endpoint at `10.128.2.241:5432`, but its capacity is exhausted:
  - `max_connections = 20`
  - `superuser_reserved_connections = 3`
  - **16 connections** from user `dbuser` at `10.128.2.243`, all **`idle in transaction`**
  - The remaining slots are consumed by PostgreSQL/system/exporter sessions.

## Connection-leak source

The 16 stuck connections originate from `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` (`10.128.2.243`).

**Evidence**
- Its logs show it opens database connections repeatedly and fails processing with:
  ```text
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
- Its current image is `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`.
- The reporting deployment was updated from **v1.0.1** to **v1.0.2** shortly after startup. The v1.0.2 pod started at `09:34:16`; database-slot failures began afterward.
- The repeated exception appears to leave transactions open, eventually consuming all non-superuser connection capacity and preventing `payments-api` from connecting.

## Other dependency status

1. **PostgreSQL — impacted but running**
   - `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`: `2/2 Running`, no restarts.
   - Its Service and endpoint are healthy.
   - It is the direct failed dependency due to exhausted connection capacity—not a network or DNS failure.

2. **Reporting service — root contributor**
   - `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`: `1/1 Running`, but functionally unhealthy due to recurring `division by zero` failures and leaked database transactions.

3. **Reconciliation service — separately unhealthy**
   - `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`: `0/1`, `CrashLoopBackOff`, 6 restarts.
   - It has no ready endpoint; probes request HTTP on port `8443` and receive HTTP `400`.
   - The Deployment exposes port `8080` but probes `8443`, so this is a probe/configuration defect. It is not evidenced as the cause of the payment 503s.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediately, reversible:** scale `shared-services/reporting-service` to `0` to stop the leak and release its PostgreSQL sessions.
2. **Restore reporting safely:** roll back `reporting-service` from `v1.0.2` to the prior `v1.0.1` image, or deploy a corrected version that handles the division-by-zero path and reliably commits/rolls back/closes DB connections.
3. **Hardening:** use bounded application connection pools and consider a PostgreSQL connection pooler; do not rely solely on increasing `max_connections`.
4. **Separately fix reconciliation:** correct its HTTP probe port/scheme/path to match the actual service listener before restoring it.

No evidence indicates a failure in the `payments-api` pod, its Service, DNS, or network path.

## Cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion

Customer payment requests to `payments/payments-api` are failing because its PostgreSQL dependency has no ordinary client connection slots available.

**Evidence**
- Active critical alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` reports a **100%** payment error rate.
- `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` logs repeatedly show:
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
  - followed by `GET /api/v1/process-payment ... 503`
- The payment API is otherwise reachable and selected by `payments/payments-api`; its pod is `1/1 Ready`, and the Service has endpoint `10.128.2.242:8080`.

The database target is explicitly configured as:
- `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`
- database: `demo`

`shared-services/postgres` is running and has endpoints on `10.128.2.241:5432`; this is not a DNS, Service, endpoint, or network-policy issue.

## Root cause in the dependency

`shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` is leaking database sessions:

- PostgreSQL is configured with `max_connections = 20` in `shared-services/postgres-init`.
- Current PostgreSQL activity shows **16** sessions from `dbuser` at reporting-service IP `10.128.2.243`, all `idle in transaction`.
- Those transactions began every ~10 seconds from `09:34:16 UTC` through `09:36:56 UTC`; each is stuck on:
  - `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`
- The reporting-service v`1.0.2` log shows the corresponding loop:
  - `Open db connection`
  - `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
- It opens a connection on each failed iteration but does not cleanly commit/rollback and close it. This consumes the database’s client slots, preventing `payments-api` from connecting.

Prometheus confirms the current state:
- `pg_stat_activity_count{namespace="shared-services",usename="dbuser",state="idle in transaction"} = 16`

## Other dependency issue

`shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is independently unavailable:

- `0/1 Ready`, `CrashLoopBackOff`, 6 restarts.
- Its Service has **no endpoints**.
- Both readiness and liveness probes call HTTP on port `8443`, but the container declares port `8080`; the kubelet receives HTTP `400`, then restarts it.

This reconciliation failure is a real dependency health issue, but it is **not evidenced as the cause** of the payment 503s. The payment failure is directly attributable to exhausted PostgreSQL connections.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediate, reversible:** stop the leak by scaling `shared-services/reporting-service` to zero or rolling it back to the last known-good release. This releases its 16 leaked sessions when the pod terminates and should allow payments to reconnect.
2. **Permanent fix:** correct reporting-service exception handling so every database path closes connections and rolls back failed transactions; fix the `division by zero` defect before re-enabling it.
3. **Hardening:** add a bounded connection pool and configure PostgreSQL idle-in-transaction timeouts. Raising `max_connections` alone only delays recurrence.
4. **Separate remediation:** correct `reconciliation-service` probes/port configuration so it stops crash-looping and regains Service endpoints.

## Root cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`

`payments/payments-api` is healthy at the pod level (`payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`, Ready `1/1`) but cannot obtain database connections.

**Evidence**
- The payment API is configured to use `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`.
- Its logs show every payment request failing with HTTP **503**, for example at `09:38:23`:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- The active `PaymentErrorRateHigh` critical alert reports a **100% payment error rate**.
- PostgreSQL is reachable and running, but its configured limit is only **20** connections (`shared-services/postgres-init` sets `max_connections = 20`; 3 are reserved for superusers).
- Current PostgreSQL activity shows **16 `dbuser` connections in `idle in transaction`**, all from client IP `10.128.2.243`, which is `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`.
- These leaked transactions run `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`, with ages from roughly 2–5 minutes. The reporting service creates another connection every 10 seconds and does not close/complete it.

This started exhausting PostgreSQL at `09:36:36`; payment failures followed as no ordinary connection slots remained.

## Dependency assessment

1. **PostgreSQL — direct blocking dependency**
   - Resource: `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
   - Service: `shared-services/postgres`
   - Status: Pod Ready `2/2`, but unable to accept normal client connections due to connection exhaustion.
   - This is the direct cause of customer-request failures.

2. **Reporting service — source of the connection leak**
   - Resource: `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`
   - Status: Ready `1/1`, but functionally unhealthy.
   - Logs repeatedly show:
     > `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
   - Each processing attempt opens a DB connection and leaves it `idle in transaction`; this is the causative workload.

3. **Reconciliation service — separately broken, not evidenced as the payment failure cause**
   - Resource: `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`
   - Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`, `0/1` Ready.
   - Its probes call HTTP on port `8443`, while the container declares port `8080`; probes receive HTTP `400`.
   - The payment deployment has no configured dependency on this service, so this does not explain the payment 503s.

## Mitigation and fix

1. **Immediate, reversible mitigation:** scale `shared-services/reporting-service` to `0` temporarily. This stops the new leaked connections, but delays report processing.
2. **Recover existing capacity:** after the reporting service is stopped, terminate its existing idle-in-transaction PostgreSQL sessions from `10.128.2.243` (or restart PostgreSQL if session termination is not feasible; this is more disruptive).
3. **Permanent fix:** correct `reporting-service` transaction/connection lifecycle so connections are committed or rolled back and closed on both success and the `division by zero` error path. Add connection-pool limits and an `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`.
4. **Capacity protection:** `max_connections=20` is very small for three clients plus monitoring. Increase it only after fixing the leak and sizing memory appropriately; raising it alone will postpone recurrence.
5. **Separate repair:** correct the reconciliation service probe scheme/port so it probes the actual serving endpoint rather than HTTP `8443`.

## Root cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion

Customer payment requests fail because `payments/payments-api` cannot obtain a PostgreSQL connection.

**Evidence**
- Active critical alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` reports **100%** payment errors.
- `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` logs repeatedly return HTTP **503** beginning at **09:38:23 UTC**:
  ```
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```
- The application is correctly configured to use its cross-namespace dependency:
  `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432` → Service IP `172.30.172.15`.
- The PostgreSQL Service and its endpoint are present and reachable; this is **not** a DNS, Service, endpoint, or NetworkPolicy failure.

## Dependency finding: `shared-services/postgres`

PostgreSQL is healthy at the pod level (`postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`, **2/2 Ready**) but has an intentionally very low connection limit:

| Database setting | Value |
|---|---:|
| `max_connections` | 20 |
| `superuser_reserved_connections` | 3 |
| Usable non-superuser slots | 17 |

At investigation time:
- Prometheus reports **16** `dbuser` sessions in `idle in transaction`.
- PostgreSQL reports **16** sessions from client IP `10.128.2.243`, which is exactly `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`.
- All leaked sessions are running:
  ```sql
  SELECT count(*) FROM reports
  ```
  and remain `idle in transaction`.
- The connection count climbed from **3 to 16** in the last 10 minutes.
- Alertmanager also has active `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` and critical `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` alerts for `shared-services`.

## Causing workload: `shared-services/reporting-service`

`reporting-service` is leaking one PostgreSQL connection every 10 seconds after a failing report-processing operation.

**Evidence**
- Its logs show the repeating pattern:
  ```
  INFO Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
- It was rolled out from `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1` to **`v1.0.2`** at **09:34:15–09:34:17 UTC** (Deployment revision **2**).
- PostgreSQL sessions from its pod began at **09:34:16 UTC** and accumulated continuously.
- Once the 17 non-superuser slots were consumed, both reporting and payment connections began failing. The payment failure alert began at **09:38:11 UTC**.

## Other dependency status

1. **PostgreSQL — causal dependency**
   - Service, endpoint, pod, and PVC are healthy.
   - Failure mode is exhausted application connection capacity caused by the reporting-service leak.

2. **`shared-services/reconciliation-service` — independently unhealthy, not evidenced as the payment cause**
   - Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is in `CrashLoopBackOff` with no ready endpoints.
   - Its probes request HTTP on port `8443`, while the container declares port `8080`; events show HTTP **400** probe failures.
   - It does not explain the PostgreSQL sessions or payment 503 errors, but requires separate remediation.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Immediate, reversible mitigation:** scale `shared-services/reporting-service` to **0**. This closes the 16 leaked connections and should restore payment capacity quickly.
2. **Restore reporting safely:** roll back `reporting-service` from `v1.0.2` to the prior `v1.0.1` revision, then verify payment requests and PostgreSQL connection counts.
3. **Permanent fix:** correct the reporting-service error path so every connection/transaction is closed or rolled back after the `division by zero` failure; use bounded connection pooling.
4. **Resilience improvement:** increase `max_connections` only after fixing the leak—it is a temporary capacity buffer, not a root-cause fix. Also set an idle-in-transaction timeout to limit recurrence.
5. **Separate fix:** correct `reconciliation-service` health probes to target the port/protocol actually served by the workload.

## Cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`

Customer payment requests are failing because `payments/payments-api` cannot obtain a database connection to its dependency:

- `payments-api` is configured to use `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`.
- Its logs show every sampled request returning **HTTP 503** with:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- The active `PaymentErrorRateHigh` critical alert reports a **100%** payment error rate.

The Payments API pod itself is healthy (`payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`, `1/1 Running`), and the PostgreSQL Service has a valid endpoint (`10.128.2.241:5432`). This is database capacity exhaustion, not a Payments API availability or network failure.

## Root cause of exhaustion

`shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` is leaking database connections:

- PostgreSQL is configured with `max_connections = 20` by `shared-services/postgres-init`.
- PostgreSQL currently reports **24 total sessions**.
- **16 sessions** are owned by user `dbuser`, all from `10.128.2.243`, which is the IP of `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`.
- All 16 are `idle in transaction`, each holding a `SELECT count(*) FROM reports` transaction open. They were accumulating at approximately one per 10 seconds.
- The reporting-service logs confirm that cadence and failure path:
  - `Open db connection`
  - `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
- This started after the reporting-service rollout to image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2` at `09:34:16`; the deployment is revision `2`.

The `division by zero` exception path in reporting-service v1.0.2 appears to leave each opened database transaction unclosed, eventually consuming the usable connection pool and blocking Payments API connections.

## Other dependency findings

1. **PostgreSQL — affected**
   - `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` is `2/2 Running` and Service endpoint is available.
   - It is emitting the `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` critical alert and `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` warning.
   - It is operational but unable to accept normal application sessions due to leaked connections.

2. **Reporting service — direct source**
   - `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` is `1/1 Running`, but application logs show repeated processing errors and connection leakage.
   - “Running” is misleading here; the workload is degrading the shared database.

3. **Reconciliation service — separate unhealthy dependency**
   - `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is in `CrashLoopBackOff` with 6 restarts.
   - Its liveness/readiness probes use **HTTP** against port `8443`, while the httpd container expects TLS there. The probes receive HTTP **400**, then kubelet restarts the pod.
   - Its Service has no ready endpoint, so it is unhealthy. However, Payments API’s configured direct dependency is PostgreSQL, and no evidence connects this crash loop to the payment 503s.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediate, reversible:** stop or roll back `shared-services/reporting-service` to the prior working `v1.0.1` revision. This prevents new leaked sessions.
2. **Immediate, reversible after stopping the leak:** terminate the 16 `dbuser` sessions from `10.128.2.243` that are `idle in transaction`, or restart the reporting-service pod after rollback. This releases connection capacity so payment requests can resume.
3. **Permanent:** fix reporting-service v1.0.2 to close/rollback database connections in the `division by zero` error path; use managed connection pooling and a bounded pool size.
4. **Capacity guardrail:** reassess the database’s `max_connections = 20` setting after fixing the leak; increasing it alone only delays recurrence.
5. **Separate repair:** correct reconciliation-service probes to use HTTPS on `8443` (or probe the actual HTTP listener/port) so it does not remain crash-looping.

## Root cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion

`payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is healthy at the pod level but cannot open database connections. Every sampled customer request fails with HTTP **503**:

```text
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

Example: at `2026-09-29 09:38:40 UTC`, transaction `637591` failed when connecting to:

```text
postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432
```

The critical `PaymentErrorRateHigh` alert reports a **100% payment error rate**.

### Database state

The dependency `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` is Running and registered behind the `shared-services/postgres` Service, so this is **not** a DNS, Service, endpoint, or network failure.

PostgreSQL configuration and active use:

| Setting / state | Value |
|---|---:|
| `max_connections` | 20 |
| `superuser_reserved_connections` | 3 |
| Connections held by `dbuser` | 16 |
| State of those 16 connections | `idle in transaction` |

That leaves only one non-reserved connection slot after normal service connections, so `payments-api` is rejected.

## Cause of the connection leak

`shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` owns all 16 leaked connections from pod IP `10.128.2.243`.

Evidence:

- Its logs repeatedly show:
  ```text
  Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
- It repeats this every 10 seconds without closing/rolling back the transaction.
- PostgreSQL shows the leaked transactions began from `09:34:16 UTC` onward, all running:
  ```sql
  SELECT count(*) FROM reports
  ```
  and left in `idle in transaction`.
- The active reporting deployment is revision 2 using `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`.

This application error plus missing cleanup on the error path exhausts PostgreSQL’s small connection limit and directly causes payment failures.

## Other dependency check

1. **PostgreSQL — impacted and causal**
   - `shared-services/postgres`: 1/1 Ready; endpoint `10.128.2.241:5432` is present.
   - It is functional but saturated by leaked reporting-service sessions.

2. **Reporting service — Running but unhealthy functionally**
   - `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`: 1/1 Ready.
   - Despite readiness, it continuously fails with `division by zero` and leaks transactions. It is the source of the database exhaustion.

3. **Reconciliation service — separate failure**
   - `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`: `0/1`, `CrashLoopBackOff`, 6 restarts.
   - Its liveness and readiness probes request `HTTP /` on port `8443`; Apache returns HTTP `400`, causing restarts.
   - Its Service has no ready endpoint.
   - `payments-api` is configured only with the PostgreSQL dependency; no evidence indicates it calls reconciliation-service, so this is **not the cause of the current payment request outage**.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediately stop the reporting connection leak** — reversible:
   - Scale `shared-services/reporting-service` to zero or roll it back to a known-good release, if one is available.
   - This releases the 16 leaked sessions when the pod terminates and should restore payment database connectivity.

2. **Correct reporting-service** — required permanent fix:
   - Fix the division-by-zero path.
   - Ensure every database error path performs rollback and closes/releases the connection.
   - Use bounded connection pooling and configure PostgreSQL `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` as a safeguard.

3. **Fix reconciliation-service probes separately**:
   - Align the probe scheme/port/path with the Apache listener. The current probe uses plaintext HTTP on `8443`, which returns `400`.

4. **Validate recovery**:
   - Confirm `idle in transaction` sessions for `dbuser` fall from 16.
   - Confirm payments no longer return 503 and the critical `PaymentErrorRateHigh` alert resolves.

## Root cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion

`payments/payments-api` is healthy at the pod/service level but cannot create database connections:

- `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is Ready with no restarts and has a Service endpoint at `10.128.2.242`.
- Its configured dependency is `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`.
- Payment logs repeatedly show:
  - `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
  - Requests to `/api/v1/process-payment` return **503**.
- The `PaymentErrorRateHigh` critical alert reports a **100%** payment error rate.

The PostgreSQL server in `shared-services` is up and reachable, but its connection capacity is consumed:

- `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` is Ready and backs the `postgres` Service endpoint `10.128.2.241:5432`.
- PostgreSQL is configured with `max_connections = 20` and `superuser_reserved_connections = 3`, leaving only **17** normal connection slots.
- Live `pg_stat_activity` shows **16 connections** from `dbuser` at `10.128.2.243`, all **`idle in transaction`**, executing `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`.
- PostgreSQL began rejecting clients at **09:36:36 UTC**, and payment failures followed.

## Causing dependency: reporting-service connection leak

The leaked connections originate from:

- `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` (`10.128.2.243`)
- Current image: `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`
- A rollout replaced `v1.0.1` with `v1.0.2` at **09:34:15–09:34:17 UTC**.
- The reporting-service opens a new DB connection every 10 seconds, then logs `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`; its connections remain open and idle in transaction.
- The first leaked session began at **09:34:16 UTC**. By **09:36:36 UTC**, normal PostgreSQL connection slots were exhausted.

This is the direct causality chain:

`reporting-service v1.0.2 error path → leaked idle transactions → PostgreSQL connection limit reached → payments-api cannot connect → customer requests return 503`

## Other cross-namespace dependency finding

`shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is independently unhealthy:

- Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`, 0/1 Ready; its Service has **no endpoints**.
- Its readiness and liveness probes use HTTP on port `8443`, which receives HTTP **400** responses.
- This is not evidenced as a direct payment dependency: the payment Deployment only configures the PostgreSQL host. It should still be corrected separately.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediately stop the leak — reversible:** roll back `shared-services/reporting-service` from `v1.0.2` to the prior known image `v1.0.1`, or scale it to zero temporarily if reporting can be paused. This closes its leaked connections and should allow payment traffic to recover.
2. **Fix `v1.0.2` before redeployment:** ensure every database connection/transaction is closed or returned to a bounded pool on both successful and exception paths; specifically handle the `division by zero` failure without leaving a transaction open.
3. **Add safeguards:** configure application-side connection pooling and a PostgreSQL `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`; review an appropriate `max_connections` value after bounding client pools.
4. **Fix reconciliation-service probes:** align protocol/port/path with the actual httpd listener so it can become Ready and receive Service endpoints.

## Diagnosis

**Customer impact:** Critical. `PaymentErrorRateHigh` reports **100% failures** in `payments`. Requests return HTTP **503**.

### Root cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion

The payment pod itself is healthy (`payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`, Ready, no restarts), and its Service has a valid endpoint. Failures occur when connecting to the cross-namespace PostgreSQL dependency:

connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local"
(172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed:
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

This is confirmed by:

- Repeated payment HTTP 503 responses from **09:38:48 onward**.
- PostgreSQL logs showing connection exhaustion beginning at **09:36:36**.
- Active alerts:
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — critical, **18 active connections**
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` — warning

### Likely source: `shared-services/reporting-service` v1.0.2

`reporting-service` was rolled from `v1.0.1` to **`v1.0.2`** at approximately **09:34:15–09:34:17**. Its logs repeatedly show:

```text
INFO Open db connection
ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
```

This repeats every ten seconds. By **09:36:36**, it also receives the PostgreSQL connection-limit error. The timing and repeated “Open db connection” followed by an exception strongly indicate that v1.0.2 leaks connections on its error path, exhausting PostgreSQL and blocking payments.

## Other dependency findings

- **PostgreSQL:** Pod `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` is Running and its Service endpoint `10.128.2.241:5432` is valid. Availability is not the issue; connection capacity is exhausted.
- **`reconciliation-service`:** Independently unhealthy:
  - Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is `CrashLoopBackOff`.
  - HTTP probes target port `8443` using plain HTTP and receive status **400**.
  - Service port is `8080`, and its only endpoint is not ready.
  - No evidence that payments directly call this service, so it is not the cause of payment 503s.

## Recommended recovery

1. **Immediate, reversible:** Roll back `shared-services/reporting-service` from `v1.0.2` to `v1.0.1` or scale it to zero.
2. **Release occupied sessions:** Restart PostgreSQL only if leaked sessions do not clear after stopping v1.0.2. This causes a brief database interruption.
3. **Permanent fix:** Ensure reporting-service closes connections in a `finally`/context-manager path when report processing raises `division by zero`; use a bounded connection pool.
4. **Reconciliation service:** Correct probes to match the actual protocol/port—likely HTTPS on `8443`, or HTTP on the configured application port—and align the Service target port.

## Diagnosis

**Root cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion caused by `shared-services/reporting-service` v1.0.2.**

### Evidence

- `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is Running/Ready, but every payment request returns **503** because PostgreSQL rejects connections:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

- The critical `PaymentErrorRateHigh` alert reports a **100% payment error rate**.

- Database alerts in `shared-services`:
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — critical, 18 active connections.
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` — warning.

- `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` was updated to **v1.0.2** at approximately `09:34:16`. Its logs show a connection leak:
  > `Open db connection`  
  > `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`

  This repeats every 10 seconds without evidence that connections are closed. PostgreSQL began rejecting reporting connections by `09:36:36`; payment failures followed.

- PostgreSQL itself is reachable and Ready:
  - Service: `shared-services/postgres`
  - Endpoint: `10.128.2.241:5432`
  - Pod: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`, `2/2 Running`
  
  Its logs repeatedly confirm connection-slot exhaustion, so this is not DNS, routing, or endpoint failure.

## Dependency status

| Dependency | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| `shared-services/postgres` | **Critical** | Running but connection capacity exhausted |
| `shared-services/reporting-service` | **Root cause** | v1.0.2 repeatedly opens connections after `division by zero` errors |
| `shared-services/reconciliation-service` | **Degraded, separate issue** | `CrashLoopBackOff`, 0/1 Ready; probes use HTTP against port `8443` and receive HTTP 400 |
| `payments/payments-api` | **Serving but functionally unavailable** | Ready pod, but payment operations return 503 due to database rejection |

The reconciliation failure does not appear to cause the current payment-request failures; those are directly tied to PostgreSQL connection exhaustion.

## Recommended action

1. **Immediate reversible mitigation:** roll `shared-services/reporting-service` back from `v1.0.2` to `v1.0.1`, or scale it to zero to stop the leak.
2. Terminate the leaked reporting database sessions or restart PostgreSQL if sessions cannot be selectively cleared. A restart causes temporary database downtime.
3. Fix reporting v1.0.2 to close/rollback connections in an exception-safe `finally`/context-manager path and correct the `division by zero`.
4. Add bounded connection pooling and per-role connection limits. Increasing PostgreSQL `max_connections` alone only postpones recurrence.
5. Separately correct `reconciliation-service` probes: its declared application port is `8080`, while liveness/readiness probe `8443` using HTTP and receive 400 responses.

## Root cause

The payment API is healthy at the pod/network level, but PostgreSQL in `shared-services` has exhausted its connection pool because `reporting-service` is leaking transactions.

### Evidence

- Critical alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` reports a **100% payment error rate**.
- `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is `Running`, Ready, with zero restarts.
- Payment logs repeatedly return HTTP `503`:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- PostgreSQL `max_connections` is **20**.
- PostgreSQL currently has **16 `idle in transaction` connections**, all from `10.128.2.243`—the IP of:
  - `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`
- Those transactions run:
  > `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`
- They accumulated every 10 seconds starting at `2026-09-29 09:34:16Z`.
- Reporting logs align exactly:
  > `Open db connection`  
  > `ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
- `reporting-service` was changed from image `v1.0.1` to **`v1.0.2`** at approximately `09:34:15Z`. The leak began immediately afterward.

**Conclusion:** `reporting-service:v1.0.2` opens a database transaction, encounters a division-by-zero exception, and fails to roll back/close the connection. This exhausts PostgreSQL and prevents `payments-api` from opening connections.

## Other dependency issue

`shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is independently in `CrashLoopBackOff`:

- Deployment availability: `0/1`
- Both probes use HTTP against port `8443`.
- Apache responds with HTTP `400`, causing liveness restarts.
- The Service exposes port `8080`, while the probes target `8443`.

This is not the direct cause of payment failures, but the dependency is unavailable and misconfigured.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Immediate, reversible:** scale `shared-services/reporting-service` to zero or roll it back to `v1.0.1`; then terminate its leaked PostgreSQL sessions. This should restore payment processing quickly.
2. **Permanent:** fix `reporting-service` to always commit/rollback and close DB connections in exception paths; also correct the division-by-zero defect and use a bounded connection pool.
3. Add PostgreSQL safeguards such as `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`. Increasing `max_connections` alone only delays recurrence.
4. Correct `reconciliation-service` probes to use the actual serving protocol/port and align the Service target port accordingly.

## Diagnosis

**Root cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion caused by `shared-services/reporting-service` v1.0.2.**

### Evidence

- `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is Running/Ready, but every sampled request returns **503**:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- The critical `PaymentErrorRateHigh` alert reports a **100% payment error rate**.
- PostgreSQL allows only **20 connections**. Current activity shows:
  - **16 connections** from `10.128.2.243`
  - User: `dbuser`
  - State: **`idle in transaction`**
- `10.128.2.243` is `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`.
- `reporting-service` was rolled from **v1.0.1 to v1.0.2** at approximately `09:34:15Z`. Its logs repeatedly show `Open db connection`; database saturation appeared by `09:36:36Z`.
- Alerts confirm **18 active connections** and `PostgresqlTooManyConnections`.

## Dependency status

| Dependency | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| `shared-services/postgres` | Running but exhausted | Service endpoint `10.128.2.241:5432` is available; connection slots are consumed by reporting-service. |
| `shared-services/reporting-service` | Ready but unhealthy functionally | v1.0.2 leaks/retains 16 `idle in transaction` connections and repeatedly reports `division by zero`. |
| `shared-services/reconciliation-service` | Down | `CrashLoopBackOff`, 0 endpoints. HTTP probes incorrectly use plain HTTP against port `8443`, receiving HTTP 400 and forcing restarts. |
| `payments/payments-api` | Ready but requests failing | Database connection rejection causes HTTP 503 responses. |

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediately scale `shared-services/reporting-service` to 0 or roll it back to v1.0.1**. This is reversible and should release its leaked connections.
2. Restart/reporting-service only after fixing connection handling: commit/rollback and close each connection, preferably using a bounded pool.
3. Do not rely solely on increasing PostgreSQL `max_connections`; that would only postpone recurrence.
4. Separately fix `reconciliation-service` probes to use the correct protocol/port—likely HTTPS on `8443`, or HTTP on its actual HTTP listener. This outage is real but is not the direct cause of payment 503s.

## Diagnosis

**Root cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion caused by `shared-services/reporting-service`.**

### Evidence

- `payments/payments-api` is running and Ready, but every payment request returns **HTTP 503**.
- Its logs repeatedly show:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- The direct dependency is:
  - `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`
  - Service endpoint: `172.30.172.15` → pod `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
- PostgreSQL is configured for only **20 connections**. `pg_stat_activity` shows:
  - **16 connections**
  - User: `dbuser`
  - Client: `10.128.2.243` (`shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`)
  - State: **`idle in transaction`**
- The critical `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` alert reports 18 active connections.
- `reporting-service` logs open a database connection every 10 seconds, then fail with:
  > `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
  
  Those error paths are leaving transactions/connections open.

### Correlated change

`shared-services/reporting-service` was rolled from image `v1.0.1` to **`v1.0.2`** at approximately **09:34:15–09:34:17 UTC**. The connection leak starts immediately in the `v1.0.2` logs, making this version the likely regression.

## Dependency status

| Dependency | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| `shared-services/postgres` | Running but exhausted | Primary cause of payment failures |
| `shared-services/reporting-service` | Ready but unhealthy functionally | `v1.0.2` leaks idle transactions after division-by-zero errors |
| `shared-services/reconciliation-service` | `CrashLoopBackOff` | Separate issue: probes use HTTP against port `8443`, which returns HTTP 400; 6 restarts observed |
| Payment route/service | Available | No routing or endpoint failure found |

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediate, reversible:** roll `shared-services/reporting-service` back to `v1.0.1` or scale it to zero, then terminate its 16 leaked database sessions. This should restore payment processing.
2. **Permanent:** fix `v1.0.2` to always rollback/close database connections in exception handling, especially after the division-by-zero failure; use a bounded connection pool.
3. **Database hardening:** add `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`. Raising `max_connections` alone only postpones recurrence.
4. **Separate issue:** correct `reconciliation-service` probes to use the proper protocol/port—currently HTTP probes target TLS port `8443` while the declared service port is `8080`.

## Diagnosis

**Customer impact:** `payments/payments-api` is returning HTTP **503** for payment requests. The active `PaymentErrorRateHigh` critical alert reports a **100% error rate**.

### Root cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion

The payment API itself is running and Ready, but every transaction fails when connecting to `shared-services/postgres`:

```text
ERROR Payment failed ... connection to server at
"postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed:
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
...
"GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
```

Supporting evidence:

- `shared-services/postgres` is Running and has endpoint `10.128.2.241:5432`.
- PostgreSQL repeatedly logs `remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`.
- Active alerts:
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — critical, **18 active connections**
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` — warning
- `shared-services/postgres-init` explicitly configures a low limit:
  ```sql
  ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 20;
  ```

### Likely source of connection exhaustion: reporting-service v1.0.2

`shared-services/reporting-service` was changed from `v1.0.1` to `v1.0.2` at approximately **09:34:15–09:34:17 UTC**. Its logs show a repeating error path every 10 seconds:

```text
INFO Open db connection
ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
```

It later starts receiving the same connection-slot error. The pattern strongly indicates that connections opened before the `division by zero` exception are not being closed. Connection alerts began around **09:36 UTC**, shortly after the rollout.

## Other dependency findings

### `shared-services/reconciliation-service` — unavailable

- Pod: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`
- State: `CrashLoopBackOff`, `0/1 Ready`
- Deployment: `0/1 available`
- Service has **no ready legacy Endpoints**
- Both probes request `/` on port `8443` using plain HTTP and receive HTTP 400:
  ```text
  Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 400
  Liveness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 400
  ```
- The container is the generic `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` image, while the Service exposes port `8080`.

This is a separate dependency failure caused by incorrect image/port/probe configuration. No evidence in the payment logs links it to the current 503 responses; those are directly caused by PostgreSQL exhaustion.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Immediate, reversible:** roll back `shared-services/reporting-service` from `v1.0.2` to `v1.0.1`. This removes the change most closely correlated with the leak.
2. **Recover database capacity:** terminate leaked idle reporting connections or restart `shared-services/postgres` after stopping/rolling back the leaking workload. A database restart is disruptive.
3. **Permanent fix:** update reporting-service to close database connections in a `finally` block/context manager when report processing raises `division by zero`; add bounded connection pooling.
4. **Database resilience:** reassess the `max_connections = 20` setting and reserve capacity for payment traffic. Raising it alone only delays recurrence if the leak remains.
5. **Reconciliation service:** deploy the intended application image and align the Service/probes with its actual protocol and port. If retaining this HTTPD image, the `8443` probe likely needs HTTPS rather than HTTP, but the intended application configuration should be confirmed first.

## Diagnosis

**Root cause: PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`.**

### Evidence

- Critical alert `PaymentErrorRateHigh` reports a **100% payment error rate** in `payments`.
- `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is Running/Ready, but every request returns HTTP **503**. Logs repeatedly show:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- The failing dependency is:
  - Service: `shared-services/postgres`
  - Endpoint: `172.30.172.15:5432`
  - Pod: `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
- PostgreSQL logs confirm continuous connection rejections from at least `09:39:05` onward.
- Active alerts corroborate this:
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` — critical, **18 active connections**
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` — warning

## Dependency assessment

1. **PostgreSQL — critical**
   - Pod and endpoint are available, but the database has exhausted normal connection slots.
   - This directly causes payment failures.

2. **`reporting-service` — unhealthy and likely leaking connections**
   - Pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` is Running, but logs show it opens a database connection every 10 seconds.
   - It repeatedly fails with `division by zero`, and later also receives PostgreSQL connection-limit errors.
   - This pattern strongly indicates connections are not being closed on the exception path.
   - A rollout from image `v1.0.1` to `v1.0.2` occurred around `09:34:15`; the current `v1.0.2` pod immediately began logging the repeated error. This is the most likely source of connection exhaustion.

3. **`reconciliation-service` — independently broken**
   - Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is in `CrashLoopBackOff`; deployment has `0/1` available replicas and its Service has **no endpoints**.
   - Cause: liveness/readiness probes send plain HTTP to port `8443`; Apache responds HTTP `400`, causing kubelet restarts.
   - The Service exposes port `8080`, while probes target `8443`, indicating a port/protocol configuration mismatch.
   - This does not appear to be the direct cause of payment request failures, but reconciliation is unavailable.

## Recommended actions

1. **Immediate reversible mitigation:** roll back `shared-services/reporting-service` from `v1.0.2` to `v1.0.1`, or scale it to zero temporarily. Then terminate its leaked PostgreSQL sessions to restore payment capacity.
2. Fix `reporting-service` so database connections are always closed or returned to a bounded pool, including when `division by zero` occurs.
3. Correct the underlying report calculation causing `division by zero`.
4. Treat increasing PostgreSQL `max_connections` only as temporary capacity relief; it will not resolve the leak.
5. Fix `reconciliation-service` probes and Service ports so protocol/port match the actual Apache listener—likely HTTPS on `8443`, or reconfigure Apache to serve the expected health endpoint on `8080`.

## Diagnosis

**Customer impact is caused by PostgreSQL connection exhaustion in `shared-services`.**

### Evidence

- Active alert: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` reports **100% payment errors** in `payments`.
- `payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` is Running/Ready, but every sampled request returns **HTTP 503**.
- Payment logs repeatedly show:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- The target database resolves successfully to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local` (`172.30.172.15:5432`), so this is not DNS or network failure.
- PostgreSQL logs confirm connection-slot exhaustion.
- Alerts report **18 active connections** for `shared-services/postgres`.

## Root cause

The likely connection leak is `shared-services/reporting-service` after its rollout from image `v1.0.1` to **`v1.0.2`** at approximately **09:34:15 UTC**:

- Every 10 seconds it logs `Open db connection`.
- Processing then fails with `division by zero`.
- After repeated failures, it begins receiving the same PostgreSQL connection-exhaustion error.
- This strongly indicates connections are not being closed on the exception path.
- The database has only **20 connection slots**, according to the active connection alert threshold/state.

## Other dependency findings

1. **PostgreSQL — critical**
   - `shared-services/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`: `2/2 Running`
   - Service endpoint exists: `10.128.2.241:5432`
   - Functionally unavailable to normal application users due to exhausted connections.

2. **Reporting service — likely leak source**
   - `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`: Running
   - Image: `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`
   - Continuously fails with `division by zero` while opening new database connections.

3. **Reconciliation service — separately broken**
   - `shared-services/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`: `CrashLoopBackOff`
   - Service has **no endpoints**.
   - Probes use plain HTTP against port `8443`; Apache returns HTTP 400, causing liveness restarts.
   - This does not appear in the payment API’s configured dependencies, so it is not the direct cause of current payment 503s.

## Recommended mitigation

1. **Immediately scale `reporting-service` to zero** to stop connection leakage. Reversible.
2. **Restart `shared-services/postgres` or terminate leaked idle sessions** to restore connection capacity. Restart is disruptive but should restore payments quickly.
3. **Roll back `reporting-service` to `v1.0.1`**, then verify connection counts remain stable. Reversible.
4. Permanently fix `v1.0.2` to close database connections in `finally`/context-manager logic when report processing raises `division by zero`.
5. Correct `reconciliation-service` probes to use HTTPS on `8443`, or probe the actual HTTP listener, and align its Service target port.

  - `superuser_reserved_connections = 3`
- Current sessions show:
  - **16 `idle in transaction` connections**
  - User: `dbuser`
  - Client: `10.128.2.243`, which is `shared-services/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`
  - Oldest connection: **2026-09-29 09:34:16 UTC**
- That pod logs a repeating application failure every 10 seconds:
  > `Open db connection`  
  > `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`
- `reporting-service` was updated from **v1.0.1 to v1.0.2** at approximately **09:34:15 UTC**. The leaked connections began at **09:34:16 UTC**, directly correlating the rollout with the outage.

## Dependency status

| Dependency | Namespace | Status | Relevance |
|---|---|---|---|
| `postgres` | `shared-services` | Running, but connection-exhausted | **Direct cause of payment failures** |
| `reporting-service` v1.0.2 | `shared-services` | Ready, functionally broken | **Connection-leak source** |
| `reconciliation-service` | `shared-services` | `CrashLoopBackOff`, 0/1 Ready | Separate issue; probes use HTTP against port 8443 and receive HTTP 400 |
| `reporting-service` Service | `shared-services` | Present | Pod is operational enough to leak DB sessions |
| `postgres` Service | `shared-services` | Present and reachable | No service-discovery/network issue |

## Recommended recovery

1. **Immediately scale `shared-services/reporting-service` to zero or roll it back to v1.0.1** — reversible.
2. Terminate its 16 stale `idle in transaction` PostgreSQL sessions. Capacity will then return immediately.
3. Fix v1.0.2 to rollback/close database connections when report processing raises `division by zero`; add transaction timeouts and connection pooling.
4. Separately correct `reconciliation-service` probes—currently `scheme: HTTP`, port `8443`, path `/` returns 400. This is not causing the payment outage but leaves another shared dependency unavailable.

Increasing `max_connections` alone would only delay recurrence because v1.0.2 continuously leaks sessions.

  Connections are apparently not closed/rolled back on that exception. By `09:36:36Z`, the reporting service itself was also receiving the PostgreSQL connection-slot error.

## Other dependency status

| Dependency | Namespace | Status | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | `shared-services` | Pod Ready, but connection-exhausted | **Direct cause of payment failures** |
| Reporting service | `shared-services` | Ready, image `v1.0.2`, leaking DB transactions | **Root cause** |
| Reconciliation service | `shared-services` | `CrashLoopBackOff`, 0/1 Ready, no ready endpoint | Separate dependency failure |

`reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is restarting because both probes send plain HTTP to port `8443`, while that port is configured for HTTPS. Each probe receives HTTP **400**, causing liveness restarts. This is not evidenced as the cause of the current payment 503s, but the dependency is unavailable.

## Recommended remediation

1. **Immediate, reversible:** roll `shared-services/reporting-service` back to image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1` or scale it to zero.
2. Terminate the 16 leaked `dbuser` sessions from client `10.128.2.243` to restore payment capacity immediately.
3. Fix `v1.0.2` to always roll back and close database connections in an exception/finally block; then redeploy.
4. Do not rely solely on increasing PostgreSQL `max_connections`; that only delays recurrence.
5. Correct reconciliation probes to use `scheme: HTTPS` on `8443`, or probe the actual HTTP listener/port.

### Investigation Summary

- **Symptoms:** The `payments-api` service in the `payments` namespace is failing 100% of customer requests (returning HTTP 503 errors).
- **Root Cause:** The PostgreSQL database (`postgres`) in the `shared-services` namespace has run out of available connection slots because they are exhausted or leaked.
- **Error Message from Logs:** 
  `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

---

### Dependency Analysis (`shared-services` Namespace)

1. **`payments-api` (`payments`)**: Depends directly on the PostgreSQL database (`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`) to process and log transactions. Failing due to exhausted database connections.
2. **`reporting-service` (`shared-services`)**: Continuously opens and closes database connections to process reports, contributing to high connection churn.
3. **`reconciliation-service` (`shared-services`)**: Currently in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state. Its logs show repeated initialization and shutdown sequences.

### Investigation Findings

#### 1. Root Cause Analysis
The `payments-api` service in the `payments` namespace is failing customer requests with `503 Service Unavailable` errors because it cannot establish connections to its shared dependency backend: **PostgreSQL (`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`)** in the `shared-services` namespace.

The database is rejecting incoming connections with the fatal error:
```text
FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
```

This occurs because the PostgreSQL database has exhausted its available connection pool slots (triggering the `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` and `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` alerts). As a result, incoming requests fail 100% of the time, driving the payment error rate to 100%.

#### 2. Dependency Analysis (`shared-services` Namespace)
- **`postgres` Pod**: Running, but completely out of connection slots due to exhaustion.
- **`reconciliation-service` Pod**: Experiencing a `CrashLoopBackOff` loop (`SharedServicesPodCrashLooping` alert), which may be contributing to or compounding connection leaks/exhaustion.
- **`reporting-service` Pod**: Running normally.

---

### Recommended Mitigation / Fix
1. **Increase max connections / Free up connection pool**:
   - Inspect active connections on the PostgreSQL database to identify connection leaks (potentially stemming from `reconciliation-service` or unclosed sessions from `payments-api`).
   - Restart or scale down leaking services temporarily if needed, or increase `max_connections` on the PostgreSQL instance.
2. **Resolve CrashLooping Dependency**:
   - Inspect the logs or deployment configuration for `reconciliation-service` in the `shared-services` namespace to fix its crash loop.

### Investigation Summary & Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. Evidence
* **Payments Service Logs (`payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`)**: 
  Failing with HTTP 503 errors and throwing database connection errors:
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=620583 amount=60.38 HKD: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```
* **Alerts (`get_alerts`)**:
  * `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` is **critical** in the `shared-services` namespace.
  * `PaymentErrorRateHigh` is **critical** in the `payments` namespace (100% error rate).
  * `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping` / `SharedServicesDeploymentReplicasMismatch` on `reconciliation-service` in the `shared-services` namespace.

---

#### 2. Root Cause
The PostgreSQL database dependency in the `shared-services` namespace (`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`) has exhausted its available connection pool slots. As a result, non-superuser connections (such as those from the `payments-api` service and other dependents) are rejected with a `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute` error.

---

#### 3. Dependencies & Inter-Namespace Assessment
* **`shared-services` Namespace**:
  * **`postgres` (`postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`)**: Running, but suffering from connection pool exhaustion due to high connection usage.
  * **`reconciliation-service` (`reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`)**: Experiencing `CrashLoopBackOff` and replica mismatch, likely contributing to connection leaks or retries flooding the database.
  * **`reporting-service` (`reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`)**: Running normally.

---

#### 4. Mitigation & Next Steps
1. **Increase PostgreSQL Max Connections**: Adjust `max_connections` in the PostgreSQL configuration or the deployment environment variables if resource limits permit.
2. **Identify Connection Leaks**: Inspect client applications (`payments-api`, `reconciliation-service`) to ensure connection pools are properly closed/reused and not leaking connections.
3. **Restart Faulty Services**: Restart or scale down the crashing `reconciliation-service` deployment to stop aggressive retry loops exhausting database slots.

### Investigation Summary

#### Root Cause
The `payments-api` pod in the `payments` namespace is failing customer requests (`503 Service Unavailable`) due to database connection failures:
- **Error:** `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- **Dependency:** The payments service attempts to connect to PostgreSQL in the `shared-services` namespace (`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`). 
- **Underlying Cause:** The PostgreSQL database has exhausted all available client connection slots, rejecting incoming connection attempts from `payments-api`.

#### Dependency Anomalies in Other Namespaces (`shared-services`)
1. **`postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`**: Running and accepting connections, but all connection slots are saturated.
2. **`reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`**: In `CrashLoopBackOff` due to a liveness/readiness probe misconfiguration (probes are checking HTTPS on port `8443` while the httpd container serves HTTP on port `8080`, causing container restarts). While not the direct cause of the connection slot exhaustion, it indicates a secondary deployment issue in the shared services.

---

### Remediation & Next Steps
1. **Mitigate Connection Exhaustion:** 
   - Inspect active database connections in PostgreSQL and terminate idle or leaked sessions.
   - Increase `max_connections` in PostgreSQL configuration if resource limits permit, or optimize the connection pool settings in the `payments-api` application configuration.
2. **Fix Reconciliation Service Probe:** 
   - Update the `reconciliation-service` deployment probes in `shared-services` to target port `8080` (or configure TLS correctly for port `8443`).

### Investigation Summary

#### 1. Evidence & Root Cause
- **Symptom**: The payment service (`payments-api`) in the `payments` namespace is failing requests with `503` errors, triggering the `PaymentErrorRateHigh` alert.
- **Root Cause**: The `payments-api` cannot process payments because it is unable to connect to the shared PostgreSQL database (`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`) due to a database connection exhaustion error:
  ```text
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```
- **Dependency Analysis (`shared-services` namespace)**:
  - **`postgres`**: Running, but completely out of available connection slots due to excessive inbound connections.
  - **`reconciliation-service`**: Running in a `CrashLoopBackOff` loop (`exitCode: 0` / rapid restart cycles), potentially leaking connections or spamming the database on startup.
  - **`reporting-service`**: Running normally.

---

### Recommended Mitigation
1. **Scale down or restart the misbehaving dependency (`reconciliation-service`)**:
   - If the reconciliation service is leaking connections during startup/crash loops, scale its deployment down temporarily to relieve connection pressure on PostgreSQL:
     ```bash
     oc scale deployment reconciliation-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
     ```
2. **Increase PostgreSQL Max Connections**:
   - If connection limits are set too low for the workload, increase `max_connections` in the PostgreSQL configuration or connection pooler settings.
3. **Inspect Connection Pooling**:
   - Ensure `payments-api` and other services are utilizing connection pooling (such as PgBouncer) to prevent connection starvation.

### Investigation Findings

#### 1. Root Cause Analysis
- **Symptom**: The payment service (`payments-api` in the `payments` namespace) is returning `503 Service Unavailable` for incoming customer payment requests, triggering the critical `PaymentErrorRateHigh` alert (100% error rate).
- **Cause**: The application logs show that every payment request fails to connect to the shared database:
  `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- **Database Dependency**: The database service (`postgres`) resides in the **`shared-services`** namespace at `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`. It has run out of available connection slots because client connections have completely exhausted the connection pool limit.

#### 2. Cross-Namespace Dependencies & Contributing Factors
- **`shared-services/reconciliation-service`**: This related dependency in the `shared-services` namespace is currently in a **`CrashLoopBackOff`** state, repeatedly failing and retrying, which may be spamming the database with connection attempts or failing to release connections properly.
- **`shared-services/reporting-service`**: Running normally, but also shares the same database backend.

### Next Steps / Mitigation (Reversible)
1. **Scale down or restart the CrashLooping reconciliation service** in the `shared-services` namespace to stop connection churn:
   ```bash
   oc scale deployment reconciliation-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
   ```
2. **Increase PostgreSQL Max Connections** or check application connection pooling configuration in `payments-api` and other workloads to prevent connection leaks.

### Root Cause Analysis

The `payments-api` service in the `payments` namespace is failing customer requests (returning HTTP `503` errors) due to a database connection failure against the shared PostgreSQL database located in the `shared-services` namespace (`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`).

#### 1. Evidence of Failure
- **Alerts:** The `PaymentErrorRateHigh` alert is firing with critical severity, reporting a **100.00% error rate** for payments.
- **Pod Logs (`payments-api`):** Every transaction fails with the following PostgreSQL error:
  ```text
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```
- **PostgreSQL Logs (`shared-services`):** Confirms that incoming client connections are being rejected because the maximum connection pool/limit has been exhausted.

#### 2. Dependencies and Inter-Namespace Investigation (`shared-services`)
The shared PostgreSQL database supports multiple services across namespaces:
- **`postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`:** The database instance is up, but out of available connections.
- **`reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`:** Currently in `CrashLoopBackOff` status, attempting rapid reconnection cycles and consuming database connections.
- **`reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`:** Running normally, but also utilizing database connection resources.

### Mitigation & Recommendations
1. **Scale down or restart the leaking/faulty dependent service:** Investigate or temporarily scale down `reconciliation-service` in the `shared-services` namespace to stop connection exhaustion.
2. **Increase PostgreSQL Max Connections:** If connection limits are set too low for the current load across namespaces, increase `max_connections` in PostgreSQL configuration.
3. **Implement Connection Pooling:** Ensure applications utilize connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer) to prevent exhausting available database connections.

### Investigation Findings & Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. Symptom
The payment service (`payments-api`) in the `payments` namespace is failing all customer requests, resulting in `503 Service Unavailable` errors and firing the **`PaymentErrorRateHigh`** critical alert.

#### 2. Root Cause
- **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion / Max Connections Reached:** 
  The PostgreSQL database (`postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`) running in the `shared-services` namespace has been configured with a very restrictive **`max_connections`** limit of **`20`**.
- Incoming connection requests from the `payments-api` pods are being rejected by PostgreSQL with the fatal error:
  `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- Consequently, transactions cannot be processed, causing 100% error rates.

#### 3. Dependencies in Other Namespaces (`shared-services`)
- **`postgres` (`shared-services`):** Reaching its maximum connection limit (`20`), causing connection rejections for the payments service.
- **`reconciliation-service` (`shared-services`):** Currently in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state due to frequent restarts (failing liveness/readiness probes or quick completion loops), which may also be contributing or competing for resources/connections.

---

### Suggested Mitigation (Reversible)
1. **Increase PostgreSQL `max_connections`:**
   Modify the PostgreSQL configuration or environment variables in the `postgres` Deployment (`shared-services`) to raise `max_connections` to a higher value (e.g., `100` or higher) to accommodate the workload of `payments-api` and other services.
2. **Review Connection Pooling:**
   Implement or tune connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer) in `payments-api` to prevent exhausting database connections.

### Investigation Results

#### 1. Symptom & Evidence
* **Payments Namespace (`payments`)**:
  * The `payments-api` deployment (`payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`) is failing all incoming customer payment requests with HTTP `503 Service Unavailable`.
  * The active Prometheus alert `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (`severity: critical`) reports a **100.00% error rate**.
  * **Pod Logs (`payments-api`)**: Show continuous connection failures to the backend database:
    ```text
    ERROR Payment failed: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
    ```

#### 2. Cross-Namespace Dependencies (`shared-services`)
* **PostgreSQL (`postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`)**:
  * The shared PostgreSQL database is up, but its connection pool has been completely exhausted. 
  * PostgreSQL logs confirm that connections are failing because all available client slots are saturated, leaving none for incoming transactions or external queries.
* **Reconciliation Service (`reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`)**:
  * Currently in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state.
  * Repeatedly spamming connection attempts to the database or failing startup due to exhausted connections/incorrect startup queries, compounding the database connection exhaustion.

---

### Root Cause
The `payments-api` service (and likely other shared consumers) are failing due to **PostgreSQL connection exhaustion** in the `shared-services` namespace. Additionally, the `reconciliation-service` in the same shared dependency namespace is in a crash loop, indicating a cascading dependency failure.

### Recommended Mitigations
1. **Scale down or restart crashing dependents (Reversible)**:
   * Temporarily scale down the `reconciliation-service` in `shared-services` to relieve connection pressure on PostgreSQL:
     ```bash
     oc scale deployment reconciliation-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
     ```
2. **Inspect and terminate rogue connections**:
   * Connect to the PostgreSQL pod as a superuser to identify connection hogs or restart the PostgreSQL pod to clear stuck connections if safe:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/postgres -n shared-services
     ```
3. **Tune connection limits**:
   * Increase `max_connections` in the PostgreSQL configuration or implement connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer) to handle spikes from the `payments` and `shared-services` namespaces.

### Summary of Investigation

The `payments-api` service in the `payments` namespace is failing 100% of customer requests (returning HTTP 503 on `/api/v1/process-payment`) due to database connection exhaustion on its backend dependency, PostgreSQL, located in the `shared-services` namespace.

---

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. Failure Symptom in `payments` Namespace
- **Workload**: `Deployment/payments-api` (`Pod/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`)
- **Alert**: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (Severity: `critical`, Error rate: `100.00%`)
- **Evidence**: `payments-api` logs show repeated connection failures to the shared PostgreSQL instance:
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  INFO 127.0.0.1 - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
  ```

---

#### 2. Cross-Namespace Dependency Root Cause (`shared-services` Namespace)
- **Shared Database**: `Deployment/postgres` (`Pod/postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`)
  - Configured with `max_connections = 20` (in `ConfigMap/postgres-init`).
  - Active alerts: `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (`critical`) and `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` (`warning`).
- **Connection Leak Source**: `Deployment/reporting-service` (`Pod/reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`)
  - The deployment was recently updated to `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2` (revision 2).
  - Logs show it executes a loop every 10 seconds, crashes with an unhandled exception (`division by zero`), and abandons the open PostgreSQL connection without closing it:
    ```text
    INFO Open db connection
    ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
    ```
  - This leaked connections until all available non-superuser connection slots (17 out of 20) were consumed, preventing `payments-api` from establishing connections.

---

#### 3. Additional Finding in `shared-services` Namespace
- **Workload**: `Deployment/reconciliation-service` (`Pod/reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`)
- **Status**: `CrashLoopBackOff` (Alerts: `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping`, `SharedServicesDeploymentReplicasMismatch`)
- **Cause**: Liveness and readiness probes are configured with `scheme: HTTP` targeting port `8443`. Because the Apache httpd container enables SSL/TLS on port `8443`, HTTP requests receive `HTTP 400 Bad Request` and fail health checks.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Stop the Connection Leak**:
   - Roll back `reporting-service` in `shared-services` to revision 1 / image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1`, or fix the unhandled `division by zero` error and ensure connections are properly closed on failure.
2. **Clear Leaked Connections**:
   - Restart the PostgreSQL pod (`postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`) or terminate idle backend connections to immediately restore capacity for `payments-api`.
3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes**:
   - Update `reconciliation-service` deployment probes to use `scheme: HTTPS` for port `8443` or point the HTTP probe to port `8080`.

### Summary of Findings

The `payments-api` service in the `payments` namespace is failing customer requests with **HTTP 503 Service Unavailable** because the shared PostgreSQL database has exhausted all available connection slots. The connection exhaustion is caused by a connection leak in `reporting-service` within the `shared-services` namespace following an application error. Additionally, another dependency in `shared-services` (`reconciliation-service`) is failing its health checks and crash looping.

---

### Evidence & Impact

1. **Payments Service (`payments` namespace):**
   - **Pod:** `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
   - **Error Log:**
     ```
     ERROR Payment failed tx=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
     INFO 127.0.0.1:... - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
     ```
   - **Metrics:** `http_requests_total{handler="/api/v1/process-payment"}` shows 226 failed requests (HTTP 503) and 84 successful requests (HTTP 200), triggering the critical alert `PaymentErrorRateHigh`.

2. **Database Connection Pool (`shared-services` namespace):**
   - **Database Pod:** `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` (`postgres:16`)
   - **Configuration:** `pg_settings_max_connections` is configured to `20`.
   - **Usage:** Currently `18` connections are active (`global_connections_connections_total=18`), triggering `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (critical).
   - **Connection Distribution:** Pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` holds `16` open connections (`reporting_active_connections=16`).

---

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. Primary Cause: Connection Leak in `reporting-service` (`shared-services` namespace)
- **Deployment:** `reporting-service` (Image: `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`)
- **Root Cause:** The `reporting-service` workload encounters an unhandled exception every 10 seconds:
  ```
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
  Each failed report attempt opens a database connection without closing it upon failure. Over time, these orphaned connections consumed 16 connection slots, preventing `payments-api` from establishing database connections.

#### 2. Secondary Issue: Misconfigured Health Probes in `reconciliation-service` (`shared-services` namespace)
- **Deployment / Pod:** `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` (Image: `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`)
- **Status:** Pod is in `CrashLoopBackOff` (7 restarts).
- **Root Cause:** Apache HTTPD is configured with SSL/TLS on port `8443`. However, the deployment's liveness and readiness probes send plain HTTP requests (`scheme: HTTP`) to port `8443`, resulting in HTTP 400 Bad Request responses:
  ```
  Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 400
  Liveness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 400
  ```

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Resolve Database Connection Exhaustion (Immediate):**
   - **Roll back / restart `reporting-service`:**
     - Roll back `reporting-service` to previous revision `v1.0.1` or restart the pod to terminate leaked database connections:
       - Scale down/restart deployment `reporting-service` in `shared-services`.
     - Fix the `division by zero` logic and ensure database connection handling uses proper cleanup/context closing (`finally` / `defer` blocks) in `reporting-service`.
   - **Increase connection limit / pooler:** Consider deploying `pgbouncer` or increasing `max_connections` in `postgres` if concurrency demands grow.

2. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Health Probes:**
   - Update the `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` definitions in Deployment `reconciliation-service` to use `scheme: HTTPS` instead of `HTTP` on port `8443`, or point probes to the non-SSL port if available.

### Summary of Findings

The payment service (`payments-api`) in the **`payments`** namespace is failing all customer requests with **HTTP 503** errors due to connection exhaustion on its shared PostgreSQL database dependency located in the **`shared-services`** namespace.

---

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Direct Failure in `payments` Namespace**:
   * **Resource**: Pod `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` (Deployment `payments-api`)
   * **Evidence**:
     * Alert **`PaymentErrorRateHigh`** is firing with a 100% error rate.
     * Pod logs report:
       ```text
       ERROR Payment failed tx=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
       INFO 127.0.0.1:42624 - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
       ```

2. **Cross-Namespace Dependency Failure (`shared-services` Namespace)**:
   * **Database**: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` (Service `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`)
     * `max_connections` is configured to **`20`** (via `postgres-init` ConfigMap).
     * Total database connections reached **`18`** (`global_connections_connections_total = 18`), leaving no available connection slots for non-superuser clients like `payments-api`.
   * **Connection Leak Source**: `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` (Image: `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`)
     * Logs show that every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` opens a database connection and fails with an unhandled exception:
       ```text
       INFO Open db connection
       ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
       ```
     * Unclosed connections remain open: **`16`** connections are currently held in the **`idle in transaction`** state (`connection_states_connections{state="idle in transaction"} = 16`, `reporting_active_connections = 16`).

3. **Additional Dependency Issue Observed (`shared-services`)**:
   * **Workload**: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is in **`CrashLoopBackOff`** (`SharedServicesPodCrashLooping`).
   * **Reason**: Liveness and readiness probes are sending plain `HTTP` requests to port `8443` (an SSL/HTTPS port on Apache HTTPD), failing with `HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 400`.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Immediate Relief (Restore Payment Processing)**:
   * Scale down or restart the `reporting-service` deployment in `shared-services` to terminate the leaked connections and free up database connection slots:
     ```bash
     oc scale deployment reporting-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
     ```
   * Alternatively, roll back `reporting-service` to the previous image version (`quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1`).

2. **Application Fixes**:
   * **`reporting-service`**: Fix the `division by zero` calculation error and wrap database operations in `try/finally` blocks to guarantee connection closure/rollback on failure.
   * **`reconciliation-service`**: Update the probe configuration in the deployment spec to either use `scheme: HTTPS` for port `8443` or target the HTTP port (`8080`).

3. **Database Tuning**:
   * Consider increasing `max_connections` in `postgres-init` / PostgreSQL configuration and placing a connection pooler (e.g., PgBouncer) in front of PostgreSQL to prevent any single client from exhausting connection capacity.

### Root Cause Analysis

The `payments-api` service in the `payments` namespace is failing 100% of payment transactions with **HTTP 503** errors because it cannot establish a connection to its backend PostgreSQL database located in the `shared-services` namespace. 

The database has exhausted its available connection pool due to a connection leak introduced in the `reporting-service`.

---

### Evidence & Findings

#### 1. `payments` Namespace
* **Workload:** `deployment/payments-api` (Pod: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`)
* **Alert:** `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (Critical — 100% error rate).
* **Logs (`payments-api`):**
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=... amount=... : connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  INFO 127.0.0.1 - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
  ```

---

#### 2. `shared-services` Namespace (Dependencies)

* **PostgreSQL (`deployment/postgres`, Service: `postgres:5432`):**
  * `max_connections` is configured to `20` in `postgres-init` ConfigMap.
  * Active alerts: `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` and `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (18+ connections held).
  * Rejects incoming client connections with `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`.

* **Reporting Service (`deployment/reporting-service`):**
  * Updated to image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2` (Revision 2).
  * **Logs:**
    ```text
    INFO Open db connection
    ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
    ```
  * Every 10 seconds, the service opens a new connection to PostgreSQL and fails with a `division by zero` error without releasing the connection. This leaks connections until PostgreSQL's connection pool is completely exhausted.

* **Reconciliation Service (`deployment/reconciliation-service`):**
  * Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is in `CrashLoopBackOff` (Alerts: `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping`, `SharedServicesDeploymentReplicasMismatch`).
  * **Cause:** Liveness and readiness probes are sending plaintext `HTTP` requests to port `8443`, but Apache `httpd` is configured with TLS/SSL on port 8443. The server responds with `HTTP 400 Bad Request`, causing health probe failures and continuous restarts.

---

### Remediation Steps

1. **Resolve Connection Leak in `reporting-service`:**
   * Roll back `reporting-service` to revision 1 (`quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1`):
     ```bash
     oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     ```
   * Alternatively, scale down the deployment until the application code is patched:
     ```bash
     oc scale deployment/reporting-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
     ```

2. **Clear Stuck PostgreSQL Connections:**
   * Restart the PostgreSQL pod to immediately release leaked connections:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/postgres -n shared-services
     ```
   * Once PostgreSQL restarts, `payments-api` will resume successfully processing payments.

3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes:**
   * Update the liveness and readiness probe schemes from `HTTP` to `HTTPS` (or target the HTTP port `8080`):
     ```yaml
     livenessProbe:
       httpGet:
         path: /
         port: 8443
         scheme: HTTPS
     readinessProbe:
       httpGet:
         path: /
         port: 8443
         scheme: HTTPS
     ```

### Summary & Findings

The payment service (`payments-api`) in the `payments` namespace is failing customer requests (HTTP 503, 100% error rate) because it cannot establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database in the `shared-services` namespace due to database connection exhaustion.

---

### Evidence & Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. Payment Service (`payments` namespace)
* **Pod**: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
* **Errors in Pod Logs**:
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=... : connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  INFO 127.0.0.1 - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
  ```
* **Alert**: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` is actively firing with a 100% error rate.

#### 2. Cross-Namespace Dependency: Database (`shared-services` namespace)
* **Pod**: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
* **Status**: PostgreSQL max connections are exhausted (`PostgresqlTooManyConnections` alert firing).
* **Metrics**: PromQL query on `pg_stat_activity_count{namespace="shared-services"}` confirms **16 connections** stuck in `idle in transaction` state under user `dbuser`.

#### 3. Root Cause: Connection Leak in `reporting-service` (`shared-services` namespace)
* **Pod**: `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` (Deployment updated to `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`)
* **Errors in Pod Logs**:
  ```text
  INFO Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
* **Mechanism**: Every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` opens a database connection and encounters an unhandled `division by zero` exception without releasing or closing the connection. This leaks connections until the PostgreSQL connection pool is exhausted, locking out `payments-api`.

#### 4. Additional Dependency Issue: `reconciliation-service` (`shared-services` namespace)
* **Pod**: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`
* **Status**: In `CrashLoopBackOff` (7+ restarts).
* **Cause**: Liveness and readiness probes are configured with HTTP `scheme: HTTP` hitting port `8443` (an SSL/HTTPS port on Apache `httpd`), returning HTTP `400 Bad Request`.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Stop the Connection Leak in `reporting-service`**:
   * Roll back `reporting-service` in `shared-services` to the previous working version (`quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1`) or scale the deployment to 0 replicas until patched:
     ```bash
     oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     ```
2. **Clear Leaked Connections / Restart PostgreSQL**:
   * Restart `postgres` in `shared-services` (or terminate the orphaned backend connections) so `payments-api` can immediately reconnect:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/postgres -n shared-services
     ```
3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes**:
   * Update the Deployment probes in `reconciliation-service` to use `scheme: HTTPS` on port 8443 (or target the HTTP port 8080).

### Diagnosis & Root Cause Summary

The **`payments-api`** service in the **`payments`** namespace is failing all customer transactions with HTTP `503 Service Unavailable` because it cannot establish a connection to its backend database (**`postgres`** in the **`shared-services`** namespace).

The root cause is a **database connection leak caused by `reporting-service`** in the **`shared-services`** namespace, which exhausted the PostgreSQL connection limit.

---

### Evidence & Dependency Analysis

#### 1. Symptom in `payments` Namespace
* **Pod**: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
* **Errors in logs**:
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  INFO 127.0.0.1:... - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
  ```
* **Alerts**: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (100% error rate).

---

#### 2. Root Cause in `shared-services` Namespace
* **`postgres` Service & Deployment**:
  * PostgreSQL `max_connections` is configured to `20` (via ConfigMap `postgres-init`).
  * Metrics (`pg_stat_activity_count{namespace="shared-services"}`) show **16 connections** stuck in `idle in transaction` state opened by user `dbuser`.
* **`reporting-service` (Deployment: `reporting-service`, Image: `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`)**:
  * Logs in pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` show that every 10 seconds it establishes a database connection and fails with an unhandled exception:
    ```text
    INFO Open db connection
    ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
    ```
  * Because the application fails to handle the exception, connections are never closed, accumulating until PostgreSQL rejects all new non-superuser connections.

---

#### 3. Additional Dependency Finding in `shared-services`
* **`reconciliation-service`** (Pod: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`):
  * In **`CrashLoopBackOff`** / continuous restarts.
  * **Cause**: Liveness and readiness probes use `scheme: HTTP` against port `8443`, but Apache is listening with SSL/TLS enabled, resulting in `HTTP 400 Bad Request` and probe failures.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Immediate Relief for `payments-api`**:
   * Restart or scale down `reporting-service` to terminate leaked connections:
     ```sh
     oc scale deployment reporting-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
     ```
   * Alternatively, restart the `postgres` pod in `shared-services` to immediately clear all leaked connection slots.

2. **Fix `reporting-service`**:
   * Roll back `reporting-service` to `v1.0.1` or deploy a fix for the `division by zero` error and ensure database connections are wrapped in proper `try...finally` / connection pool release logic.

3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes**:
   * Update the Deployment's `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` to use `scheme: HTTPS` instead of `HTTP` on port `8443`.

### Diagnosis Summary

The payment service (**`payments-api`**) in the **`payments`** namespace is failing all customer requests (100% error rate, HTTP 503) due to **PostgreSQL connection pool exhaustion** caused by a connection leak in **`shared-services/reporting-service`**.

---

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Direct Cause in `payments` Namespace**:
   * **Pod**: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
   * **Error**: The payment service cannot connect to the backend database at `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`:
     ```text
     ERROR Payment failed: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed:
     FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
     ```
   * **Alert Active**: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (100% failure rate).

2. **Underlying Cause in `shared-services` Namespace**:
   * **Database Limits**: PostgreSQL (`postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`) is configured with `max_connections = 20` (with 3 slots reserved for superusers, allowing up to 17 standard client connections).
   * **Connection Leak**: The `reporting-service` (`reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`, running image `v1.0.2`) repeatedly attempts to process pending reports every 10 seconds, hits an application exception (`Failed to process pending reports: division by zero`), and abandons connections without closing them.
   * **Prometheus Metrics Evidence (`pg_stat_activity_count`)**:
     * `dbuser` (`reporting-service`): **16 connections** stuck in `idle in transaction`
     * `demo` (`payments-api`): Connections blocked due to pool exhaustion
   * **Alerts Active**: `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (Critical), `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` (Warning).

---

### Additional Dependency Findings (`shared-services`)

* **`reconciliation-service` (`reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`)**:
  * **Status**: `CrashLoopBackOff` (7+ restarts).
  * **Cause**: Liveness and readiness probes are configured with `scheme: HTTP` targeting port `8443`. Because the Apache container has SSL enabled on port 8443, the probe receives `HTTP 400 Bad Request`, causing kubelet to repeatedly kill the container.

---

### Recommended Remediation

1. **Mitigate Immediate Payment Outage**:
   * Restart or scale down `reporting-service` in `shared-services` (`oc scale deployment reporting-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services` or rollback to `v1.0.1`) to release the leaked connections immediately.
   * Restart the PostgreSQL pod `postgres` if hung transactions remain.
2. **Fix `reporting-service`**:
   * Address the `division by zero` logic in `reporting-service` image `v1.0.2` and ensure database connections are closed/released in `finally` blocks or managed via connection pooling.
3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes**:
   * Update the deployment probe spec to use `scheme: HTTPS` on port `8443` or target the unencrypted HTTP port (`8080`).
4. **Tune Database Capacity**:
   * Increase `max_connections` or introduce a connection pooler (such as PgBouncer) to prevent noisy neighbor services from exhausting shared database capacity.

### Root Cause Summary
The `payments-api` service in the `payments` namespace is failing incoming payment requests with **HTTP 503** errors because its backend database dependency, **PostgreSQL (`postgres.shared-services`)**, has exhausted all available client connection slots (`FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`). 

The connection exhaustion is caused by a **connection leak in `reporting-service` (`shared-services` namespace)** following a recent deployment update to version `v1.0.2`.

---

### Key Evidence & Findings

#### 1. Symptom in `payments` Namespace
* **Workload:** `payments-api` (Pod: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`)
* **Alert:** `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (Critical — 100% error rate).
* **Pod Logs:**
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=... amount=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  INFO 127.0.0.1:... - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
  ```

#### 2. Cross-Namespace Dependency: `shared-services`
* **Database (`postgres`):**
  * Configuration limits: `max_connections = 20` (configured in ConfigMap `postgres-init`).
  * Current connections:
    * `16` connections held by user `dbuser` in `idle in transaction` state.
    * `2` active connections from `demo`.
    * Total active/held connections = `18/20`, exhausting non-superuser connection slots.
  * Active Alerts: `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` and `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh`.

* **Root Cause Workload (`reporting-service`):**
  * **Image:** `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2` (Pod: `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`).
  * **Behavior:** Every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` attempts to process pending reports, fails with an unhandled exception (`division by zero`), and abandons the open connection without closing it or rolling back the transaction:
    ```text
    INFO Open db connection
    ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
    ```

#### 3. Additional Dependency Finding (`reconciliation-service`)
* **Workload:** `reconciliation-service` (Pod: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`) in `shared-services`.
* **Status:** `CrashLoopBackOff` (`0/1 Ready`).
* **Cause:** Probe configuration error — Liveness and Readiness probes are configured with `scheme: HTTP` against port `8443`, but Apache httpd is configured for SSL/TLS (HTTPS) on port 8443, resulting in `400 Bad Request` probe failures.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Immediate Mitigation (Restore `payments-api` availability):**
   * Restart or scale down `reporting-service` in `shared-services` to terminate leaked idle connections:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     # or
     oc scale deployment/reporting-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
     ```
   * Alternatively, roll back `reporting-service` to previous revision `v1.0.1`.

2. **Fix `reporting-service` Application Logic:**
   * Fix the `division by zero` calculation error in `reporting-service:v1.0.2`.
   * Implement proper connection handling using `try...finally` blocks or connection pooling to ensure database connections are closed or returned to the pool upon error.

3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes:**
   * Update `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` in `reconciliation-service` to use `scheme: HTTPS` on port `8443` or target the unencrypted port `8080`.

### Evidence & Findings

#### 1. Payment Service (`payments` namespace)
* **Workload:** Pod `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` (Deployment `payments-api`).
* **Symptom:** Logs show every payment transaction fails when attempting to query PostgreSQL:
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  INFO 127.0.0.1:... - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
  ```
* **Alert:** `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (Critical, 100% error rate).

#### 2. Cross-Namespace Dependencies (`shared-services` namespace)
* **PostgreSQL Database (`postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`):**
  * PostgreSQL is configured with `max_connections = 20` (3 slots reserved for superusers).
  * Metrics show active connections reached **18** (`pg_stat_database_numbackends = 18`), firing the alerts `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` and `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (Critical).
  * Non-superuser connection attempts from `payments-api` are rejected.

* **Reporting Service (`reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`):**
  * **Root Cause of Connection Leak:** The deployment was updated to image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`.
  * Logs reveal that every 10 seconds, the service opens a new connection to `postgres` and fails during report processing:
    ```text
    INFO Open db connection
    ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
    ```
  * Unhandled exceptions prevent connections from being closed or returned to the pool, rapidly consuming all available connection slots.

* **Reconciliation Service (`reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`):**
  * In `CrashLoopBackOff` due to misconfigured liveness/readiness probes sending plain HTTP requests to port 8443 (returning HTTP 400).

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Roll back / Patch `reporting-service`:**
   * Roll back `reporting-service` to revision 1 / image `v1.0.1` (or deploy a patch that properly closes database connections in exception blocks):
     ```bash
     oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     ```
2. **Release Stale Database Connections:**
   * Restart the `postgres` pod in `shared-services` to immediately terminate orphaned leaked connections and restore availability to `payments-api`:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/postgres -n shared-services
     ```
3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes:**
   * Update the container probes to use `scheme: HTTPS` or target the correct HTTP port (`8080`) to resolve the crash loop.

  * **Current Usage:** `18` connections total (`16` connections in `idle in transaction` state, plus active metric scraping sessions).
  * Because PostgreSQL reserves slots for superuser roles (`superuser_reserved_connections`), all regular application connection slots are exhausted.

* **`reporting-service` (Pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` - Image `ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`):**
  * **Issue:** Every 10 seconds, it opens a database connection and encounters an unhandled exception (`division by zero`), failing to close or return the connection to the pool (`reporting_active_connections = 16`).
  * **Pod Log Evidence:**
    ```text
    INFO Open db connection
    ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
    ```

* **`reconciliation-service` (Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`):**
  * **Issue:** Unrelated dependency in `CrashLoopBackOff` (`7+` restarts).
  * **Cause:** Misconfigured readiness/liveness probes sending plain `HTTP` requests to SSL/TLS port `8443`, receiving HTTP `400 Bad Request` and triggering container restarts:
    ```text
    "GET / HTTP/1.0" 400 362
    AH01909: 10.128.2.240:8443:0 server certificate does NOT include an ID which matches the server name
    ```

---

### Remediation & Next Steps

1. **Immediate Relief for Payment Processing:**
   * Scale down or restart `reporting-service` in `shared-services` to terminate orphaned connections and free database slots for `payments-api`:
     ```bash
     oc scale deployment reporting-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
     ```
2. **Fix `reporting-service`:**
   * Resolve the `division by zero` error in the report processing logic and ensure database connections are closed in a `finally` block or context manager upon errors.
3. **Database Tuning:**
   * If traffic requires higher capacity, update `max_connections` in `postgres-init` ConfigMap / PostgreSQL settings in `shared-services`.
4. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes:**
   * Update the Deployment probes in `reconciliation-service` to use `scheme: HTTPS` for port `8443` or target the HTTP port `8080`.

### Diagnosis & Summary

The **`payments-api`** service in the **`payments`** namespace is failing all customer requests (`GET /api/v1/process-payment` returning **HTTP 503**) because it cannot establish a connection to its backend PostgreSQL database hosted in the **`shared-services`** namespace. 

The database has reached its connection capacity due to an active connection leak in a co-dependent service, **`reporting-service`**, in the **`shared-services`** namespace.

---

### Evidence

#### 1. Payment Service (`payments` namespace)
* **Workload & Pod:** `Deployment/payments-api`, Pod `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
* **Alert:** `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (critical, firing with 100% error rate).
* **Pod Logs:**
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  INFO 127.0.0.1:... - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
  ```

#### 2. PostgreSQL Dependency (`shared-services` namespace)
* **Workload & Pod:** `Deployment/postgres`, Pod `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
* **Configuration:** PostgreSQL is configured with `max_connections = 20` (`pg_settings_max_connections = 20`), reserving 3 connection slots for superuser roles (`superuser_reserved_connections = 3`), leaving 17 slots for application connections.
* **Alerts:** `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` and `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (critical) reporting 18 active connections.
* **Connection Status (`pg_stat_activity` / Prometheus):**
  * `global_connections_connections_total`: **18**
  * `reporting_active_connections`: **16** connections held by client IP `10.128.2.243` (`reporting-service`).

#### 3. Root Cause Dependency: `reporting-service` (`shared-services` namespace)
* **Workload & Pod:** `Deployment/reporting-service`, Pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` (IP: `10.128.2.243`)
* **Recent Change:** Deployment was updated to revision 2 using image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2` (previously `v1.0.1`).
* **Source Code Bug (`/app/app.py`):**
  ```python
  conn = psycopg2.connect()
  active_connections.inc()
  connections.append(conn)
  cur = conn.cursor()
  cur.execute("SELECT count(*) FROM reports")
  total = cur.fetchone()[0]
  x = total / 0  # <--- Causes ZeroDivisionError
  ```
  Every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` opens a new database connection and appends it to `connections = []`. When the `total / 0` exception triggers, the exception is caught, but the connection is never closed or released. This exhausts all regular connection slots within ~3 minutes of starting.

---

### Additional Namespace Findings (`shared-services`)
* **`Deployment/reconciliation-service`:** Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is in `CrashLoopBackOff` (Alert: `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping`). Its readiness/liveness probes are sending HTTP requests to Apache's TLS listener on port `8443`, triggering HTTP 400 failures. This is independent of `payments-api`, which only connects to PostgreSQL.

---

### Remediation & Next Steps

1. **Immediate Mitigation (Reversible):**
   * Restart or scale down `reporting-service` in the `shared-services` namespace to drop the leaked database connections:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     ```
   * As soon as the leaked connections terminate, `payments-api` will be able to connect to PostgreSQL immediately.

2. **Rollback / Code Fix:**
   * Roll back `reporting-service` to image version `v1.0.1`:
     ```bash
     oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     ```
   * Or patch `reporting-service` to close database connections in a `finally` block or context manager (`with psycopg2.connect(...) as conn:`) and resolve the division-by-zero calculation.

3. **Long-Term Preventive Measures:**
   * Introduce a connection pooler such as **PgBouncer** between clients and PostgreSQL to prevent runaway services from starving others.
   * Adjust PostgreSQL's `max_connections` or configure connection limits per user (`ALTER ROLE dbuser CONNECTION LIMIT ...;`).

### Summary of Findings

The `payments-api` service in the `payments` namespace is failing incoming payment requests with **HTTP 503 (Database unavailable)** due to connection exhaustion on its backend PostgreSQL database located in the **`shared-services`** namespace. 

The exhaustion is caused by a connection leak bug in another dependent workload in `shared-services` (**`reporting-service`**), which holds open unclosed database transactions after encountering a division-by-zero error.

---

### Evidence & Diagnosis

#### 1. Affected Service: `payments/payments-api`
- **Resource:** Deployment `payments-api`, Pod `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
- **Alert:** `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (Critical, firing since `2026-09-29T09:38:11Z` with 100% failure rate)
- **Metrics:** `http_requests_total{code="503",namespace="payments"}` has reached **317 errors** versus 84 successful 200 responses.
- **Pod Logs (`payments-api`):**
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=... amount=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  INFO 127.0.0.1:... - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
  ```
- **Direct Cause:** `payments-api` attempts to connect as non-superuser `dbuser` to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432` but is rejected because all non-superuser connection slots are exhausted.

---

### Cross-Namespace Dependency Analysis (`shared-services`)

#### 2. Database Dependency: `shared-services/postgres`
- **Resource:** Deployment `postgres`, Pod `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
- **Alerts:** `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` (Warning) and `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (Critical)
- **Configuration:** `max_connections` is set to **20** (via `postgres-init` ConfigMap), and `superuser_reserved_connections` is **3**, leaving only **17** connection slots for non-superuser applications.
- **Active Sessions (`pg_stat_activity`):**
  - **16 connections** are held in `idle in transaction` state running `SELECT count(*) FROM reports`.
  - All 16 leaked connections originate from client IP **`10.128.2.243`**, which corresponds to pod **`reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`**.

#### 3. Root Cause Dependency: `shared-services/reporting-service`
- **Resource:** Deployment `reporting-service`, Pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` (IP `10.128.2.243`)
- **Image:** `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2` (recently rolled out; previous revision was `v1.0.1`)
- **Metric:** `reporting_active_connections` = **16**, `reporting_queries_total{status="error"}` = **48**
- **Code Bug in `/app/app.py`:**
  Every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` opens a new connection to PostgreSQL and executes:
  ```python
  conn = psycopg2.connect()
  connections.append(conn)
  cur = conn.cursor()
  cur.execute("SELECT count(*) FROM reports")
  total = cur.fetchone()[0]
  x = total / 0  # ZeroDivisionError
  ```
  The exception is caught by a general `except Exception:`, but the database connection is never closed or rolled back. Each 10-second iteration leaks an open connection in an `idle in transaction` state until the database completely exhausts its non-superuser limit.

#### 4. Additional Finding: `shared-services/reconciliation-service`
- **Resource:** Deployment `reconciliation-service`, Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`
- **Status:** **`CrashLoopBackOff`** (7+ restarts)
- **Alerts:** `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping`, `SharedServicesDeploymentReplicasMismatch`
- **Cause:** Probe configuration mismatch. The container runs Apache `httpd` with TLS on port 8443, but the readiness and liveness probes send plain HTTP (`scheme: HTTP`), receiving HTTP 400 Bad Request responses and failing probes. While `payments-api` does not call this service directly, it is an unhealthy component of the same application suite.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Immediate Restoration of `payments-api` (Reversible):**
   - Scale down `reporting-service` to 0 replicas to release all leaked connections immediately:
     ```bash
     oc scale deployment reporting-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
     ```
   - Alternatively, terminate the leaked sessions from PostgreSQL:
     ```sql
     SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
     FROM pg_stat_activity 
     WHERE usename = 'dbuser' AND state = 'idle in transaction';
     ```

2. **Fix `reporting-service`:**
   - Roll back to image version `v1.0.1`:
     ```bash
     oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     ```
   - In `v1.0.2`, remove the division by zero (`total / 0`) and ensure database connections are wrapped in context managers (`with psycopg2.connect(...) as conn:`) or explicitly closed in a `finally` block.

3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes:**
   - Update the liveness and readiness probe schemes to `HTTPS` (or target the HTTP port 8080) in `shared-services/reconciliation-service`.

4. **Tune PostgreSQL Connection Limits:**
   - Increase `max_connections` beyond 20 in the `postgres-init` ConfigMap and database configuration to accommodate peak concurrent workloads and prevent single-service denial-of-service.

### Root Cause Summary
Customer requests to `payments-api` in the **`payments`** namespace are failing with **HTTP 503** (100% error rate) because the shared PostgreSQL database in the **`shared-services`** namespace has run out of connection slots. This exhaustion is caused by a connection leak in **`reporting-service`** following its recent update.

---

### Evidence & Diagnostic Details

#### 1. Payment Service (`payments` namespace)
* **Workload & Pod:** Deployment `payments-api`, Pod `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
* **Dependency:** Configured with `PGHOST=postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`, `PGDATABASE=demo`.
* **Pod Logs:**
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=389097 amount=250.02 NOK: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute

  ```
* **Alerts:** Critical alert `PaymentErrorRateHigh` is firing with an error rate of 100.00%.

---

#### 2. Cross-Namespace Dependencies (`shared-services` namespace)

##### A. PostgreSQL Database (`postgres`)
* **Pod:** `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
* **Configuration:** 
  * `max_connections` = **20**
  * `superuser_reserved_connections` = **3**
  * Available slots for application roles = **17**
* **Prometheus Metrics (`pg_stat_activity_count{namespace="shared-services"}`):**
  * Total connections active: **18** (exceeding non-superuser capacity).
  * **16 connections** are held in `idle in transaction` state by user **`dbuser`**.
* **Alerts:** `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` and `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` are actively firing.

##### B. Leaking Dependency: `reporting-service`
* **Deployment & Pod:** `reporting-service`, Pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`
* **Change Correlation:** Recently rolled out revision 2 updating the image from `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1` to `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`.
* **Pod Logs:**
  ```text
  INFO Starting reporting-service v1.0.2
  INFO Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  INFO Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
* **Mechanism:** Every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` connects to PostgreSQL as `dbuser` and throws an unhandled `division by zero` exception before releasing the connection. The connections remain leaked in `idle in transaction` state until the database pool is completely exhausted.

##### C. Additional Finding: `reconciliation-service`
* **Pod:** `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` (in `shared-services`)
* **Status:** In `CrashLoopBackOff` (alert `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping`).
* **Cause:** Liveness and readiness probes fail with HTTP 400 because they send plaintext HTTP probes to an SSL-enabled port (`8443`). While part of the same application suite, it is independent of the payment failure.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Mitigate the Connection Leak:**
   * Roll back `reporting-service` to version `v1.0.1` or scale it to 0 replicas:
     ```bash
     oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     # Or temporarily:
     oc scale deployment/reporting-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
     ```
2. **Clear Leaked PostgreSQL Connections:**
   * Restart the `postgres` pod to immediately release the hung connections, or terminate the idle backends:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/postgres -n shared-services
     ```
3. **Preventive Improvements:**
   * Fix the unhandled `division by zero` error and add proper connection cleanup (`finally` block / connection pooling) in `reporting-service:v1.0.2`.
   * Configure `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` in PostgreSQL to automatically close abandoned transactions.
   * Update `reconciliation-service` probe schemes to HTTPS (`scheme: HTTPS`) on port 8443.

### Diagnosis

The **`payments-api`** service in the **`payments`** namespace is failing 100% of customer requests with HTTP 503 (`PaymentErrorRateHigh` alert is firing). The root cause is a database connection exhaustion cascade triggered by a connection leak in a dependent shared service in the **`shared-services`** namespace.

---

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. Direct Cause in `payments` Namespace
* **Workload:** Pod `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` (Deployment `payments-api`)
* **Error:** When attempting to process transactions (`GET /api/v1/process-payment`), calls fail with:
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=... amount=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  INFO 127.0.0.1 - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
  ```
* `payments-api` cannot acquire a connection to PostgreSQL and returns HTTP 503 to callers.

---

### Investigation of Dependencies in `shared-services`

The payment platform's shared backend components in namespace `shared-services` were inspected:

#### 1. `postgres` (Deployment `postgres`, Pod `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`)
* **Status:** Running, but connection pool exhausted. Alerts `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` and `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` are actively firing.
* **Configuration:** `max_connections` is restricted to **20** in the `postgres-init` ConfigMap:
  ```sql
  ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 20;
  ```
  With PostgreSQL reserving 3 slots for superusers (`superuser_reserved_connections`), only **17** connections are available for application roles.
* **Metric `pg_stat_activity_count{namespace="shared-services"}`:**
  * `state="idle in transaction", usename="dbuser"`: **16 connections**
  * `state="active", usename="demo"`: **2 connections**
  * `state="idle", usename="demo"`: **1 connection**
  * Total non-superuser connections = 19 (exceeding the 17-connection limit).

#### 2. `reporting-service` (Deployment `reporting-service`, Pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`)
* **Status:** Running, but actively leaking database connections.
* **Trigger:** Rolled out with image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2` (revision 2).
* **Logs:** Every 10 seconds, the service opens a connection as `dbuser` and throws an unhandled exception without closing the connection:
  ```text
  INFO Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
* Because connections are left unclosed in the `idle in transaction` state, all 16–17 available slots were consumed within minutes of rollout, starving `payments-api`.

#### 3. `reconciliation-service` (Deployment `reconciliation-service`, Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`)
* **Status:** `CrashLoopBackOff` (Restart count: 7+, alert `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping` firing).
* **Root Cause:** Probes misconfiguration.
  * The Apache HTTP server container (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`) generates an SSL certificate and serves HTTPS on port 8443.
  * Both `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` are configured with `scheme: HTTP` to port 8443:
    ```yaml
    httpGet:
      path: /
      port: 8443
      scheme: HTTP
    ```
  * Apache rejects HTTP probes with `HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 400`, causing the kubelet to continually kill and restart the container.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

#### Immediate Mitigation (Restore Payment Processing)
1. **Roll back or scale down `reporting-service`:**
   * Roll back to `v1.0.1`:
     ```bash
     oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     ```
   * Or scale it down temporarily to immediately free connections:
     ```bash
     oc scale deployment/reporting-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
     ```
2. **Clear leaked connections on PostgreSQL:**
   * Restart the PostgreSQL pod to terminate existing leaked sessions:
     ```bash
     oc delete pod -l app=postgres -n shared-services
     ```

#### Permanent Fixes
1. **`reporting-service`:**
   * Fix the `division by zero` logic error.
   * Ensure database connection handling wraps queries in a `try...finally` block or uses a managed connection pool to guarantee connection closure on failure.
2. **PostgreSQL Configuration:**
   * Increase `max_connections` in `postgres-init` ConfigMap from 20 to a realistic production limit (e.g., 100), or deploy a connection pooler (such as PgBouncer).
3. **`reconciliation-service` Probes:**
   * Update the Deployment to set `scheme: HTTPS` on both liveness and readiness probes:
     ```bash
     oc patch deployment reconciliation-service -n shared-services --type='json' -p='[
       {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/livenessProbe/httpGet/scheme", "value": "HTTPS"},
       {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/readinessProbe/httpGet/scheme", "value": "HTTPS"}
     ]'
     ```

### 1. Summary of Symptoms & Impact

* **Affected Service**: `payments-api` (Deployment `payments-api`, Pod `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`) in namespace `payments`.
* **Symptom**: All incoming customer requests (`GET /api/v1/process-payment`) fail with **HTTP 503 Service Unavailable** (`detail: "Database unavailable"`), triggering the critical alert `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (100% failure rate).
* **Direct Cause**: Database connections to PostgreSQL fail immediately with:
  ```text
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```

---

### 2. Dependency Investigation (`shared-services` Namespace)

The `payments-api` service depends directly on the shared database located in the `shared-services` namespace: `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`.

An investigation of the `shared-services` namespace reveals the root cause and the status of related dependencies:

#### Dependency A: `postgres` (Deployment `postgres`, Pod `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`)
* **Configuration**: `max_connections` is configured to `20` in ConfigMap `postgres-init` (`ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 20;`). PostgreSQL reserves 3 connections for superuser roles (`superuser_reserved_connections`), leaving only 17 usable slots for standard users (`dbuser`).
* **Connection State**: Prometheus metric `pg_stat_activity_count` confirms 19 active/held connections (16 in `idle in transaction` under user `dbuser`, and 3 system/admin sessions under `demo`), leaving zero available connection slots for non-superuser clients.

#### Dependency B: `reporting-service` (Deployment `reporting-service`, Pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`) — **Primary Root Cause**
* **Deployment Change**: Updated to revision 2 (`quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`).
* **Evidence**: In `/app/app.py`:
  ```python
  connections = []
  while True:
      conn = psycopg2.connect()
      connections.append(conn)
      cur = conn.cursor()
      cur.execute("SELECT count(*) FROM reports")
      total = cur.fetchone()[0]
      x = total / 0  # ZeroDivisionError bug
  ```
  Every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` opens a PostgreSQL connection as `dbuser`, stores it in a persistent list `connections`, and hits an unhandled `division by zero` error. The connection is never closed, leaking connections into `idle in transaction` until all available database connection slots are exhausted.

#### Dependency C: `reconciliation-service` (Deployment `reconciliation-service`, Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`) — **Secondary Failure**
* **Status**: In `CrashLoopBackOff` (0/1 ready, 7+ restarts).
* **Evidence**: The Apache HTTPD server (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`) is listening on port `8443` with SSL/TLS enabled. However, the deployment's `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` are sending plain `HTTP` requests:
  ```yaml
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /
      port: 8443
      scheme: HTTP   # Fails with HTTP 400 Bad Request
  ```
  The probe receives `400 Bad Request`, causing Kubernetes to continuously restart the container. (Note: `payments-api` does not call this service directly, but it shares the application boundary).

---

### 3. Recommended Mitigations & Fixes

1. **Immediate Relief (Restore Payment Processing)**:
   * **Scale down or restart `reporting-service`**:
     ```bash
     oc scale deployment reporting-service -n shared-services --replicas=0
     ```
     This terminates the leaked connection handles held by the pod, immediately freeing connection slots in PostgreSQL and restoring `payments-api` functionality.
   * Alternatively, roll back `reporting-service` to image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1`.

2. **Fix `reporting-service` Code**:
   * Wrap database operations in `try...finally` or context managers (`with psycopg2.connect(...) as conn:`) to guarantee connections are closed even on exceptions.
   * Remove the `total / 0` division bug.

3. **Database Capacity**:
   * In ConfigMap `postgres-init` (or via PostgreSQL settings), increase `max_connections` (e.g., to 100) or deploy a connection pooler (such as PgBouncer) to prevent a single misbehaving client from starving critical services like payments.

4. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probe**:
   * Update the liveness and readiness probes in `reconciliation-service` to use `scheme: HTTPS` instead of `scheme: HTTP` on port `8443`.

The **payment service** (`payments-api` in namespace `payments`) is failing 100% of incoming customer requests with **HTTP 503 Service Unavailable** (`detail: "Database unavailable"`). 

The root cause is **PostgreSQL connection pool exhaustion** in the `shared-services` namespace caused by a connection leak in **`reporting-service`** following its deployment upgrade to `v1.0.2`.

---

### Evidence & Symptoms

1. **`payments-api` Pod Logs & Errors** (`payments/payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`):
   ```text
   ERROR Payment failed tx=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed:
   FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
   INFO 127.0.0.1 - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
   ```
2. **Alerts Firing**:
   - `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (Critical, namespace: `payments`): Payment error rate is 100.00%.
   - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` / `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` (Critical / Warning, namespace: `shared-services`): 18 active connections detected.
   - `SharedServicesDeploymentReplicasMismatch` & `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping` (Warning, namespace: `shared-services`).
3. **Prometheus Metrics**:
   - `global_connections_max_connections`: **`20`**
   - `global_connections_connections_total`: **`18`**
   - `connection_states_connections{state="idle in transaction"}`: **`16`**
   - `reporting_active_connections`: **`16`**
   - `http_requests_total{namespace="payments",code="503"}`: **`253`** vs **`84`** successful (`200`).

---

### Root Cause Analysis across Dependencies

#### 1. Primary Dependency: `postgres` (`shared-services`)
- **Configuration**: `max_connections` is explicitly limited to **`20`** (via `postgres-init` ConfigMap).
- With PostgreSQL’s default `superuser_reserved_connections = 3`, non-superuser connections (`dbuser` used by `payments-api`) are blocked when active connections reach 17.
- Because 18 connections are active, PostgreSQL rejects all non-superuser connection attempts.

#### 2. Dependency: `reporting-service` (`shared-services`) – *Source of the Leak*
- **Recent Change**: Updated from revision 1 (`quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1`) to revision 2 (`quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`).
- **Logs (`reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`)**:
  ```text
  INFO Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
- Every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` opens a database connection, triggers an unhandled `division by zero` error, and abandons the connection without closing it.
- This leaked **16 connections** into an `idle in transaction` state, saturating PostgreSQL.

#### 3. Additional Dependency Finding: `reconciliation-service` (`shared-services`)
- **Status**: Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is in **`CrashLoopBackOff`** (7+ restarts).
- **Cause**: Liveness and readiness probes are configured with `port: 8443` and `scheme: HTTP`. Apache HTTPD on port 8443 requires TLS/HTTPS, rejecting HTTP probe requests with `HTTP 400 Bad Request`, causing kubelet to repeatedly fail probes and kill the container.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

#### Step 1: Immediate Relief for Payment Traffic
1. **Roll back `reporting-service`** to version `v1.0.1` (or delete the pod to immediately release leaked connections):
   ```bash
   oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
   ```
   *Alternatively, scale it down temporarily:*
   ```bash
   oc scale deployment/reporting-service --replicas=0 -n shared-services
   ```
2. Once the leaked connections drop, `payments-api` will immediately be able to establish database connections and resume processing transactions.

#### Step 2: Preventative Fixes
1. **Fix `reporting-service` application code**: Ensure database connections are managed with proper context managers or `try...finally` blocks to close connections upon exceptions, and fix the zero-division error.
2. **Tune PostgreSQL limits**: Increase `max_connections` (or configure PgBouncer connection pooling) in the `postgres-init` ConfigMap / PostgreSQL configuration to handle higher concurrency.
3. **Fix `reconciliation-service` probes**: Update the deployment probes to use `scheme: HTTPS` for port 8443, or target the HTTP port 8080 with `scheme: HTTP`:
   ```bash
   oc patch deployment/reconciliation-service -n shared-services --type='json' -p='[
     {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/livenessProbe/httpGet/scheme", "value": "HTTPS"},
     {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/readinessProbe/httpGet/scheme", "value": "HTTPS"}
   ]'
   ```

### Summary of Investigation

The **`payments-api`** service in the **`payments`** namespace is failing all customer requests with **HTTP 503** errors because its backend database dependency, **`postgres`** in the **`shared-services`** namespace, has exhausted all available non-superuser connection slots.

The connection pool exhaustion was triggered by a connection leak in another dependent workload, **`reporting-service`** (also in **`shared-services`**), following its update to `v1.0.2`.

---

### Evidence & Findings

#### 1. Affected Workload (`payments` Namespace)
- **Pod:** `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
- **Alert:** `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (Critical, firing at 100.00% error rate).
- **Metrics (`http_requests_total`):**
  - `code="200"`: 84 (prior to connection exhaustion)
  - `code="503"`: 265+ (all current requests failing)
- **Pod Logs (`payments-api`):**
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  INFO 127.0.0.1:... - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
  ```

---

#### 2. Cross-Namespace Dependency Analysis (`shared-services` Namespace)

`payments-api` connects to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432` with user `dbuser`.

##### A. PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion (`postgres` Deployment)
- **Postgres Limits:**
  - `max_connections`: `20` (configured in `postgres-init` ConfigMap)
  - `superuser_reserved_connections`: `3`
  - Total non-superuser slots available: `17`
- **Active Connections (`pg_stat_activity` / `pg_stat_activity_count`):**
  - **16 connections** in state `idle in transaction` belonging to `dbuser` from IP `10.128.2.243` (`reporting-service`).
  - **1-2 connections** used by `postgres-exporter`.
  - All 17 non-superuser connection slots are completely exhausted, triggering PostgreSQL alert `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (Critical).

##### B. Root Cause: Leaking Connections in `reporting-service`
- **Pod:** `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`
- **Image:** `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2` (rollout revision 2)
- **Logs:**
  ```text
  INFO Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  INFO Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
  Every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` opens a database connection, encounters an unhandled `division by zero` exception, and abandons the connection in `idle in transaction` without closing it.

##### C. Secondary Finding: `reconciliation-service` CrashLoop
- **Pod:** `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` (Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`)
- **Root Cause:** Probes are configured with `scheme: HTTP` hitting port `8443` (an HTTPS/SSL port). Apache returns `HTTP 400 Bad Request`, causing liveness/readiness probes to fail repeatedly.

---

### Root Cause
1. **`reporting-service:v1.0.2`** leaks database connections on each crash/error cycle due to an unhandled `division by zero` exception without releasing the connection.
2. PostgreSQL's low `max_connections = 20` threshold is quickly saturated by these leaked `idle in transaction` sessions.
3. Once all 17 non-superuser connection slots are occupied, incoming database connections from **`payments-api`** are rejected with `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`, causing 100% of customer payment transactions to fail with HTTP 503.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Stop the Connection Leak (Roll back or scale down `reporting-service`):**
   - Roll back deployment `reporting-service` in `shared-services` to revision 1 (`quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1`), or scale replicas to `0` while fixing the division by zero bug:
     ```bash
     oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
     ```

2. **Terminate Leaked PostgreSQL Sessions:**
   - Terminate the leaked idle connections or restart the PostgreSQL pod:
     ```sql
     SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
     FROM pg_stat_activity 
     WHERE usename = 'dbuser' AND state = 'idle in transaction';
     ```
     Or restart the pod:
     ```bash
     oc rollout restart deployment/postgres -n shared-services
     ```

3. **Increase Capacity / Add Connection Pooling (Preventative):**
   - Update `max_connections` in `postgres-init` ConfigMap to a higher limit appropriate for workload sizing, and introduce a connection pooler (e.g., PgBouncer).

4. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes:**
   - In `reconciliation-service` deployment, update probe scheme to `HTTPS` for port `8443` or target port `8080`.

### Diagnosis & Summary
The payment service (`payments-api`) in the `payments` namespace is failing 100% of customer requests (HTTP 503) due to **PostgreSQL connection pool exhaustion** in the dependency namespace `shared-services`. 

The connection exhaustion is caused by a **connection leak in `reporting-service`** following an unhandled `ZeroDivisionError` bug introduced in version `v1.0.2`.

---

### Evidence

#### 1. Affected Service (`payments` Namespace)
- **Pod**: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` (Deployment `payments-api`)
- **Active Alert**: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (Critical) — 100.00% error rate.
- **Log Errors**:
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  INFO 127.0.0.1:... - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
  ```

#### 2. Dependencies in `shared-services` Namespace

##### **A. PostgreSQL Database (`postgres`)**
- **Pod**: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`
- **Configuration** (`postgres-init` ConfigMap): `max_connections = 20`. With 3 slots reserved for superusers, only 17 slots are available for application connections (`dbuser`).
- **Active Alerts**:
  - `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` (Warning)
  - `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (Critical) — 18 active connections detected.
- **`pg_stat_activity` Output**:
  16 out of 17 available connections were held in an `idle in transaction` state originating from IP `10.128.2.243` (`reporting-service`).

##### **B. Culprit Service: `reporting-service`**
- **Pod**: `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` (Deployment `reporting-service`, image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`)
- **Pod Logs**:
  ```text
  INFO Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
- **Code Inspection (`/app/app.py`)**:
  ```python
  with query_duration.time():
      conn = psycopg2.connect()
      connection_failures = 0
      active_connections.inc()
      connections.append(conn)
      cur = conn.cursor()
      cur.execute("SELECT count(*) FROM reports")
      total = cur.fetchone()[0]
      x = total / 0  # <--- Causes ZeroDivisionError
  ```
  Every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` opens a connection, appends it to an in-memory `connections` list, triggers a `ZeroDivisionError`, and catches the exception without closing the connection. This quickly leaks all available database slots.

##### **C. Collateral Issue: `reconciliation-service`**
- **Pod**: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` (Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`)
- **Active Alert**: `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping`
- **Cause**: Liveness and readiness probes specify `scheme: HTTP` to port `8443`, but Apache is configured with TLS enabled, returning `HTTP 400 Bad Request` to plain HTTP probe requests.

---

### Root Cause
1. **Primary Root Cause**: `reporting-service` v1.0.2 leaks PostgreSQL connections due to a division-by-zero error occurring before connection closure.
2. **Cascading Failure**: PostgreSQL runs with `max_connections = 20`. Once `reporting-service` consumes all 17 non-superuser slots, `payments-api` is locked out and rejects incoming payment requests with HTTP 503.

---

### Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Immediate Mitigation (Restore `payments-api` immediately)**:
   - Scale down or rollback `reporting-service` in `shared-services`:
     - Revert Deployment `reporting-service` to image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1` (or scale replicas to `0`).
   - Terminate the leaked connections or restart the PostgreSQL pod (`postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`) to release connection slots.

2. **Code Fix for `reporting-service`**:
   - Remove the `total / 0` division bug in `/app/app.py`.
   - Wrap connection management in a context manager (`with psycopg2.connect() as conn:`) or a `finally:` block to ensure connections are always closed when exceptions occur.

3. **Database Architecture & Sizing**:
   - Increase `max_connections` beyond 20 in `postgres-init` ConfigMap or PostgreSQL configuration.
   - Implement connection pooling (such as PgBouncer) between microservices and PostgreSQL.

4. **Fix for `reconciliation-service`**:
   - In Deployment `reconciliation-service`, update `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` to use `scheme: HTTPS` instead of `scheme: HTTP`.

### Diagnosis Summary

The `payments-api` service in the `payments` namespace is failing 100% of customer requests with HTTP **503 Service Unavailable** due to connection exhaustion on its shared database dependency in the **`shared-services`** namespace.

---

### Evidence

1. **`payments` Namespace**:
   - **Pod**: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
   - **Alert**: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (Critical, firing since `2026-09-29T09:38:11Z`): Error rate is 100%.
   - **Logs**: Every request to `/api/v1/process-payment` fails to connect to the database:
     ```
     ERROR Payment failed: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
     INFO 127.0.0.1 - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
     ```

2. **`shared-services` Namespace (PostgreSQL Dependency)**:
   - **Pod**: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` (Service: `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`)
   - **Limits**: `max_connections` is configured to **20** (via ConfigMap `postgres-init`), with `superuser_reserved_connections` set to **3**, leaving only **17** non-superuser connection slots.
   - **Active Alert**: `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (Critical) / `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` (Warning).
   - **Active Connection Inspection (`pg_stat_activity`)**:
     - User `dbuser` from IP `10.128.2.243` holds **16 connections** in state `idle in transaction`.
     - `global_connections_connections_total` metric is currently **18**.

3. **`shared-services` Namespace (Causal Workload)**:
   - **Pod**: `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` (IP: `10.128.2.243`)
   - **Rollout**: Updated from image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1` to `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2` at `2026-09-29T09:34:15Z`.
   - **Code & Log Evidence (`app.py`)**:
     - Every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` opens a connection (`conn = psycopg2.connect()`), appends it to a global list `connections`, and hits an unhandled division by zero (`x = total / 0`):
       ```
       INFO Starting reporting-service v1.0.2
       INFO Open db connection
       ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
       ```
     - Leaked connections are never closed, accumulating rapidly (`reporting_active_connections = 16`).

4. **Other Dependencies in `shared-services`**:
   - **`reconciliation-service`**: Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is in `CrashLoopBackOff`. Liveness and readiness probes fail with HTTP 400 because plain HTTP probes are querying an HTTPS/TLS-enabled port (`8443`). While this does not directly block `payments-api`, it affects overall transaction processing reconciliation.

---

### Root Cause Chain

1. `reporting-service` was updated to `v1.0.2`.
2. A code bug (`total / 0`) inside `reporting-service` causes an exception before closing database connections, retaining them in memory.
3. Every 10 seconds a new connection is leaked until all 17 usable slots on `postgres.shared-services` are consumed.
4. `payments-api` is locked out with `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`, rejecting all payment processing requests.

---

### Remediation

1. **Immediate Mitigation (Restore Payments)**:
   - Roll back the `reporting-service` deployment to revision 1 / image `v1.0.1` (or scale it to 0 replicas):
     - Workload: `Deployment/reporting-service` in namespace `shared-services`.
     - Target image: `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1`.
   - Terminating the `reporting-service` pod will release the leaked PostgreSQL connection slots, immediately restoring `payments-api`.

2. **Long-Term Fixes**:
   - **Code Fix in `reporting-service`**: Ensure database connections are managed via context managers (`with psycopg2.connect(...) as conn:`) or closed in `finally` blocks, and fix the zero-division error in report processing.
   - **PostgreSQL Configuration**: Increase `max_connections` in `postgres-init` ConfigMap if legitimate application concurrency exceeds 20, or introduce a connection pooler (e.g., PgBouncer).
   - **Fix `reconciliation-service` Probes**: Update the liveness/readiness probes on `reconciliation-service` to use `scheme: HTTPS` on port 8443 instead of `HTTP`.

### Investigation Summary

The **payments-api** service in the **payments** namespace is failing all payment requests with **HTTP 503**, caused by database connection exhaustion on the shared PostgreSQL instance in the **shared-services** namespace. The connection pool has been exhausted by a connection leak in **reporting-service**. Additionally, **reconciliation-service** in **shared-services** is in `CrashLoopBackOff` due to misconfigured health probes.

### Evidence

#### 1. Payment Service (`payments` namespace)
* **Workload**: Deployment `payments-api`, Pod `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`
* **Alert**: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (Critical – error rate at 100%)
* **Metrics**: `http_requests_total{namespace="payments", code="503"}` recorded 317+ failed requests.
* **Pod Logs**:
  ```text
  ERROR Payment failed tx=...: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" (172.30.172.15), port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  INFO 127.0.0.1:... - "GET /api/v1/process-payment HTTP/1.1" 503
  ```

#### 2. PostgreSQL Dependency (`shared-services` namespace)
* **Workload**: Deployment `postgres`, Pod `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz`, Service `postgres` (`172.30.172.15:5432`)
* **Configuration**: `max_connections` is capped at **20** (via ConfigMap `postgres-init`). PostgreSQL reserves 3 connections for superusers by default, leaving 17 available for application users.
* **Alerts**:
  * `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (Critical – 18+ active connections)
  * `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` (Warning)
* **Metrics**:
  * `global_connections_connections_total{namespace="shared-services"}` = **18** (out of 20)
  * `connection_states_connections{state="idle in transaction"}` = **16**
  * `reporting_active_connections{namespace="shared-services"}` = **16**

#### 3. Reporting Service (`shared-services` namespace)
* **Workload**: Deployment `reporting-service`, Pod `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb`
* **Image**: Recently updated to `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2`
* **Pod Logs**:
  ```text
  INFO Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
  Every 10 seconds, `reporting-service` opens a database connection, encounters an unhandled `division by zero` error, and abandons the connection in an `idle in transaction` state without closing it. This consumed 16 connection slots, locking out `payments-api`.

#### 4. Additional Dependency: Reconciliation Service (`shared-services` namespace)
* **Workload**: Deployment `reconciliation-service`, Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q`
* **Status**: `CrashLoopBackOff`
* **Alerts**: `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping`, `SharedServicesDeploymentReplicasMismatch`
* **Cause**: Liveness and readiness probes query port `8443` using plain `HTTP` (`httpGet.scheme: HTTP`), but the container (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`) serves HTTPS on port 8443. The probe receives HTTP 400 (`Bad Request`), causing Kubernetes to repeatedly restart the container.

---

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Direct Cause of Payment Failure**: `payments-api` cannot connect to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432` because all non-superuser connection slots are filled.
2. **Underlying Cause**: `reporting-service` (v1.0.2) in `shared-services` leaks connections whenever its report processing job crashes on `division by zero`.
3. **Database Bottleneck**: PostgreSQL's `max_connections` is set to 20, making connection pool exhaustion occur rapidly.

---

### Recommended Remediation

#### Immediate Mitigations
1. **Restore Payment Processing**:
   * Scale down or restart `reporting-service` in `shared-services` to terminate its leaked connections:
     ```bash
     oc scale deployment reporting-service -n shared-services --replicas=0
     ```
     Alternatively, roll back `reporting-service` to the previous image `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1`.
   * Restart the PostgreSQL pod `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` if connections remain in an unreleased state.

2. **Fix `reconciliation-service` Health Probes**:
   * Update the deployment `reconciliation-service` in `shared-services` so the probes use `scheme: HTTPS` on port 8443, or probe the unencrypted HTTP port (`8080`).

#### Long-Term Fixes
1. **Patch `reporting-service`**:
   * Fix the `division by zero` error in `ts01-reporting-service`.
   * Ensure database connection handling wraps queries in a `try...finally` or context manager block so connections are closed or returned to the pool on failure.
2. **Database Capacity & Connection Pooling**:
   * Increase `max_connections` beyond 20 in PostgreSQL or implement a connection pooler such as **PgBouncer** between services and the database.

I'll investigate the payment service issue by gathering information from multiple angles simultaneously.I can see critical alerts firing. Let me dig deeper into the payment service logs and investigate the dependencies in the `shared-services` namespace, which has related alerts.The root cause is clear. Now let me get the PostgreSQL logs and the crash-looping reconciliation service logs to understand the connection exhaustion.Now let me check the PostgreSQL connection settings and the reporting service's connection leak behavior.Now let me check the reporting service deployment to understand the connection leak, and look at the reconciliation service more closely.I now have a complete picture. Here's the full diagnosis.

## Diagnosis: Payment Service Failure

### Root Cause: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion in `shared-services` Namespace

The `payments-api` pod in the `payments` namespace is returning **HTTP 503 on 100% of requests** because the shared PostgreSQL database has run out of available connections.

### Evidence Chain

#### 1. PostgreSQL Connection Pool Saturated (Primary Cause)
- **Database**: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` in `shared-services` namespace
- **`max_connections` = 20**, **`superuser_reserved_connections` = 3** → only **17 slots** available for regular users
- **Current usage**: **18 backends** connected to the `demo` database, of which **16 are `idle in transaction`** (held by user `dbuser`) and **2 are `active`** (from user `demo`)
- All 17 non-superuser slots are consumed, so every new connection attempt gets:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

#### 2. Connection Leak from `reporting-service` (Root Cause of Exhaustion)
- **Pod**: `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` (image `v1.0.2`, recently upgraded from `v1.0.1`)
- The reporting service opens a new DB connection **every 10 seconds** (`"Open db connection"` log entries) but **never closes them**, leaving them in `idle in transaction` state
- It also has a persistent application bug: `"Failed to process pending reports: division by zero"` — the error occurs on every cycle, but the connection is not released
- **16 leaked `idle in transaction` connections** from user `dbuser` are consuming nearly all available slots
- The `v1.0.1` → `v1.0.2` image upgrade (visible in events: old ReplicaSet `reporting-service-76d5ddbcf6` was scaled down) likely introduced this connection leak

#### 3. Impact on `payments-api`
- **Pod**: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` in `payments` namespace (Running, 1/1 Ready)
- Connects to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432` on database `demo`
- Every payment transaction fails immediately because no connection slots remain
- **Alert**: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (critical) — 100% error rate, exceeding the 15% threshold

#### 4. Collateral Damage: `reconciliation-service` in CrashLoopBackOff
- **Pod**: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` — **CrashLoopBackOff** (7 restarts)
- **Separate issue**: This pod is running the wrong image (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` — a generic Apache HTTPD), not an actual reconciliation service application
- Its liveness/readiness probes target port `8443` with HTTP scheme, but the HTTPD container serves HTTPS on `8443`, causing `HTTP 400` responses → liveness failure → restart loop
- This is a misconfiguration, not caused by the DB issue

### Affected Alerts
| Alert | Namespace | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PaymentErrorRateHigh` | `payments` | **Critical** | 100% error rate |
| `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` | `shared-services` | **Critical** | 18 active connections |
| `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` | `shared-services` | **Warning** | Connection usage high |
| `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping` | `shared-services` | **Warning** | reconciliation-service crash loop |
| `SharedServicesDeploymentReplicasMismatch` | `shared-services` | **Warning** | reconciliation-service 0/1 ready |

### Recommended Fix

**Immediate — Restore payment processing (reversible):**
1. **Restart the `reporting-service` pod** to release the 16 leaked `idle in transaction` connections:
   ```
   oc delete pod reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb -n shared-services
   ```
   ⚠️ This is a temporary fix — the new pod will start leaking connections again within ~3 minutes.

2. **Roll back `reporting-service` to `v1.0.1`** (the version before the connection leak was introduced):
   ```
   oc set image deployment/reporting-service reporting-service=quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1 -n shared-services
   ```

**Longer-term improvements:**
3. **Increase `max_connections`** on PostgreSQL (e.g., to 100+) to provide headroom, or deploy a connection pooler like PgBouncer in front of PostgreSQL.
4. **Fix the `reporting-service` v1.0.2 code** — it must close DB connections after use (or use a connection pool), and fix the `division by zero` bug.
5. **Fix the `reconciliation-service` deployment** — replace the image `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` with the correct application image, and fix the probe configuration (either use HTTPS scheme for port 8443, or probe port 8080).

## Diagnosis: Payment Service Outage — 100% Error Rate

### Root Cause: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion

The PostgreSQL database in `shared-services` namespace has **all connection slots consumed**, preventing the `payments-api` from processing any transactions.

### Evidence Chain

#### 1. PostgreSQL Connection Pool Saturated (Primary Cause)
| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `max_connections` | **20** |
| `superuser_reserved_connections` | **3** |
| Available for regular users | **17** |
| Current backends on `demo` database | **18** (exceeds limit) |
| Connections in `idle in transaction` state | **16** (by user `dbuser`) |

**16 out of 17 usable slots are held by `dbuser` in `idle in transaction` state** — these are leaked connections that opened a transaction but never committed/rolled back. This leaves zero slots for new connections from the payment service.

#### 2. `reporting-service` (shared-services) — Connection Leak Source
- **Pod**: `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` — Running, but **continuously erroring**
- **Image**: `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2` (recently updated from `v1.0.1`)
- **Behavior**: Opens a new DB connection every **10 seconds**, hits a `division by zero` error, and **never closes the connection/transaction**. This is the connection leak:
  ```
  INFO Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
- The `v1.0.2` image was deployed as a rolling update (the old `v1.0.1` ReplicaSet `reporting-service-76d5ddbcf6` was scaled down). The bug was introduced in this version.

#### 3. `payments-api` (payments) — Victim
- **Pod**: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` — Running (1/1 Ready), but **100% of requests return HTTP 503**
- Every payment attempt fails with:
  > `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- The pod itself is healthy; it simply cannot connect to the database.

#### 4. `reconciliation-service` (shared-services) — Misconfigured, CrashLooping
- **Pod**: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` — **CrashLoopBackOff** (7 restarts)
- **Wrong image**: Deployed with `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` (a generic Apache HTTPD image), not an actual reconciliation service application
- **Probe misconfiguration**: Liveness/readiness probes send HTTP GET to port `8443` using `scheme: HTTP`, but the HTTPD container listens on HTTPS at port 8443 → returns HTTP 400 → probe fails → container killed
- This is a separate deployment issue, not directly causing the payment outage, but it means the reconciliation service is completely non-functional.

#### 5. Active Alerts Confirming the Issue
| Alert | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PaymentErrorRateHigh` | **Critical** | Payment error rate is 100% (threshold: 15%) |
| `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` | **Critical** | 18 active connections detected |
| `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` | **Warning** | Database using 19 connections |
| `SharedServicesPodCrashLooping` | **Warning** | reconciliation-service pod crash looping |
| `SharedServicesDeploymentReplicasMismatch` | **Warning** | reconciliation-service has 0/1 ready replicas |

---

### Fix — Immediate (Reversible)

**1. Stop the connection leak — roll back `reporting-service` to v1.0.1:**
```bash
oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
```
This will revert to the previous `v1.0.1` image that didn't have the `division by zero` / connection leak bug.

**2. Kill leaked connections — restart the PostgreSQL pod to clear all `idle in transaction` sessions:**
```bash
oc delete pod postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz -n shared-services
```
This forces all leaked connections to drop. The pod will be recreated by its Deployment.

> ⚠️ Alternatively, if you have superuser access to PostgreSQL, you can terminate idle sessions without restarting: `SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'idle in transaction';`

**3. Fix `reconciliation-service` deployment** (separate issue):
- Replace the image from `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` to the correct reconciliation service application image
- Fix the probes: either change the scheme to `HTTPS` for port 8443, or point probes to port 8080 with `HTTP`

### Fix — Long-term
- **Increase `max_connections`** on PostgreSQL (currently only 20, which is very low for a shared database)
- **Set `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`** on PostgreSQL to automatically kill leaked transactions (currently 0 = disabled)
- **Add connection pooling** (e.g., PgBouncer) in front of PostgreSQL to manage connection limits
- **Fix the `division by zero` bug** in `reporting-service:v1.0.2` before redeploying

Let me visualize the connection leak over time.## Diagnosis: Payment Service Outage

### Root Cause

The `payments-api` in the `payments` namespace is returning **100% HTTP 503 errors** because the shared **PostgreSQL database** (`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`) has **exhausted all available connection slots**.

### Evidence Chain

#### 1. PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion (Primary Cause)
- **`max_connections` = 20**, **`superuser_reserved_connections` = 3** → only **17 usable slots** for regular users
- **18 backends** are currently connected to the `demo` database, meaning all non-superuser slots are consumed
- **16 of those 18 connections** are in **`idle in transaction`** state, held by user **`dbuser`** — this is a **connection leak**
- PostgreSQL is rejecting all new connections with: `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

#### 2. Connection Leak Source: `reporting-service` (namespace: `shared-services`)
- The `reporting-service` (`v1.0.2`) opens a new DB connection **every 10 seconds** (`"Open db connection"` log entries) but **never closes them**
- Each iteration hits a `division by zero` error, but the connection remains open in a transaction
- This service was recently **upgraded from `v1.0.1` to `v1.0.2`** (events show the old ReplicaSet `reporting-service-76d5ddbcf6` was scaled down and replaced by `reporting-service-6d7f67656f`), which likely introduced the bug
- Over ~7 minutes, it accumulated 16+ leaked connections, saturating the pool

#### 3. Cascading Failures
| Component | Namespace | Status | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **payments-api** | `payments` | Running but 100% errors | Cannot connect to DB → all payment requests fail with 503 |
| **reporting-service** | `shared-services` | Running (leaking connections) | `division by zero` bug + connection leak introduced in `v1.0.2` |
| **reconciliation-service** | `shared-services` | CrashLoopBackOff (7 restarts) | Wrong container image (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` — a generic Apache HTTPD, not a reconciliation service). Liveness/readiness probes target port 8443 via HTTP but get 400 responses, causing repeated kills. Also cannot connect to DB. |

#### 4. Active Alerts
- **`PaymentErrorRateHigh`** (critical) — 100% error rate in `payments` namespace
- **`PostgresqlTooManyConnections`** (critical) — 18 active connections
- **`PostgresqlConnectionsHigh`** (warning) — 19 connections detected
- **`SharedServicesPodCrashLooping`** (warning) — `reconciliation-service` crash looping
- **`SharedServicesDeploymentReplicasMismatch`** (warning) — `reconciliation-service` 0/1 ready

### Fix — Immediate Mitigation

**Step 1: Roll back `reporting-service` to `v1.0.1`** to stop the connection leak:
```
oc -n shared-services set image deployment/reporting-service \
  reporting-service=quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1
```
This is **reversible** — you can roll forward again once the bug is fixed.

**Step 2: Restart the PostgreSQL pod** to clear the 16 leaked `idle in transaction` connections:
```
oc -n shared-services rollout restart deployment/postgres
```
This will terminate all leaked connections and allow `payments-api` to reconnect. **Note:** This causes a brief DB outage.

Alternatively, if you have superuser access, connect to PostgreSQL and terminate the idle sessions:
```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'idle in transaction' AND usename = 'dbuser';
```

**Step 3: Fix `reconciliation-service` deployment** — it's using the wrong container image (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` instead of an actual reconciliation service image). Update the deployment with the correct image. Additionally, the health probes are misconfigured (HTTP probe on HTTPS port 8443).

### Longer-Term Recommendations

1. **Increase `max_connections`** on PostgreSQL (currently only 20) — this is very low for a multi-service setup
2. **Enforce connection pooling** (e.g., PgBouncer) in front of PostgreSQL to prevent any single service from exhausting the pool
3. **Set `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`** on PostgreSQL to automatically kill leaked connections
4. **Fix the `v1.0.2` reporting-service code** — address both the `division by zero` bug and the connection leak before redeploying

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion in `shared-services` Namespace

The **payments-api** pod (`payments-api-559656657c-jfn89`) in the `payments` namespace is returning **HTTP 503** on every payment request because it cannot connect to its PostgreSQL database at `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`.

**Error from every payment attempt:**
> `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

### Why Connections Are Exhausted

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `max_connections` | **20** |
| `superuser_reserved_connections` | **3** |
| Available for regular users | **17** |
| Currently `idle in transaction` (user: `dbuser`) | **16** |
| Currently `active` (user: `demo`) | **2** |
| **Total used** | **18** (exceeds the 17 non-superuser limit) |

**16 connections are stuck in `idle in transaction` state** held by user `dbuser`. This is a **connection leak** — transactions are being opened but never committed or rolled back.

### Connection Leak Source: `reporting-service` (v1.0.2)

The `reporting-service` deployment in `shared-services` was **recently updated from v1.0.1 → v1.0.2** (revision 2). Its logs show:

1. It opens a new DB connection every **10 seconds** (`"Open db connection"`)
2. Every attempt fails with: `"Failed to process pending reports: division by zero"`
3. The application **never closes/releases the connection** after the error — classic connection leak pattern

The `division by zero` bug in v1.0.2 causes the application to error out without properly closing the transaction, leaving connections in `idle in transaction` state. Over time, these leaked connections filled all 17 available slots.

### Cascading Failures

| Component | Namespace | Status | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **reporting-service** (v1.0.2) | `shared-services` | Running but leaking connections | **Root cause** — bug in v1.0.2 leaks DB connections |
| **PostgreSQL** | `shared-services` | Running, connections saturated (18/17 non-superuser) | All new non-superuser connections rejected |
| **payments-api** | `payments` | Running, 100% error rate | Cannot connect to DB → all payments fail with 503 |
| **reconciliation-service** | `shared-services` | CrashLoopBackOff (7 restarts) | Wrong container image (`httpd-24` instead of a reconciliation app); liveness/readiness probes hitting HTTPS port 8443 via HTTP → 400 responses → killed repeatedly. **Separate issue, not causing the connection leak.** |

---

## Recommended Fix

### 1. Immediate: Roll back `reporting-service` to v1.0.1 (reversible)

This will stop the connection leak at the source:

```bash
oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
```

### 2. Immediate: Terminate leaked connections

After the rollback, the 16 `idle in transaction` connections held by `dbuser` need to be cleared. Restart the PostgreSQL pod to force-close all connections:

```bash
oc delete pod postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz -n shared-services
```

Or, if you have superuser access to PostgreSQL, run:
```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'idle in transaction' AND usename = 'dbuser';
```

### 3. Short-term: Increase `max_connections` (reversible)

The current limit of 20 is very low. Increase it to at least 100 in the PostgreSQL configuration to provide more headroom.

### 4. Fix `reconciliation-service` deployment (separate issue)

This pod is using the wrong image (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` — a generic Apache HTTPD image, not a reconciliation service). The health probes are configured for HTTP on port 8443 (which is HTTPS), causing 400 responses and CrashLoopBackOff. The correct application image and probe configuration need to be applied.

- **`max_connections` = 20**, **`superuser_reserved_connections` = 3** → only **17 slots** available for regular users
- **16 connections** are currently held in **`idle in transaction`** state by user **`dbuser`** on database `demo`

- PostgreSQL is rejecting all new connections with: `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

#### 2. Connection Leak Source: `reporting-service` (namespace: `shared-services`)

- Each iteration hits a `division by zero` error, likely causing the transaction to remain open without commit/rollback
- The `idle in transaction` count grew from **3 → 16** over the last 10 minutes, confirming a steady leak
- The `reporting-service` was recently updated: events show the old ReplicaSet `reporting-service-76d5ddbcf6` (image `v1.0.1`) was replaced by `reporting-service-6d7f67656f` (image `v1.0.2`) — **the v1.0.2 rollout introduced this bug**

### Recommended Fix

**Immediate — Restore payment processing (reversible):**

1. **Roll back `reporting-service` to v1.0.1** to stop the connection leak:
   ```
   oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
   ```
2. After rollback, the leaked `idle in transaction` connections will be released when the old pod terminates, freeing slots for `payments-api`.

**If rollback alone doesn't free connections fast enough:**
- Restart the PostgreSQL pod to force-close all leaked connections (causes brief downtime):
  ```
  oc delete pod postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz -n shared-services
  ```

**Longer-term fixes:**
1. **Fix the `reporting-service` v1.0.2 code** — the `division by zero` bug causes transactions to remain open without proper cleanup. Connections must be closed/returned in a `finally` block.
2. **Increase `max_connections`** on PostgreSQL (currently only 20) to provide more headroom.
3. **Add connection pooling** (e.g., PgBouncer) in front of PostgreSQL to manage connection limits across multiple services.
4. **Set `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`** on PostgreSQL to automatically kill leaked connections.

**For the `reconciliation-service` (separate issue):**
- Fix the Deployment to use the correct application image instead of `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`
- Fix the liveness/readiness probes to use the correct port and scheme (currently probing HTTPS port 8443 with HTTP scheme)

Let me visualize the connection leak over time.## Diagnosis: Payment Service Failure

### Root Cause: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion in `shared-services` Namespace

The `payments-api` pod is **not broken itself** — it is a victim of a **connection leak** in the shared PostgreSQL database (`postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local`).

---

### Evidence Chain

**1. PostgreSQL connection pool is fully exhausted**

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `max_connections` | **20** |
| `superuser_reserved_connections` | **3** |
| Available for regular users | **17** |
| Currently `idle in transaction` (user: `dbuser`) | **16** |
| Currently `active` (user: `demo`) | **2** |
| **Total used** | **18 (≥ 17 limit)** |

All non-superuser connection slots are consumed. Every new connection attempt gets:
> `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

**2. The connection leak originates from `reporting-service` (namespace: `shared-services`)**

The `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` pod (image `v1.0.2`, recently rolled out from `v1.0.1`) is opening a new database connection **every 10 seconds** and hitting a `division by zero` error — but **never closing/committing the transaction**. This leaves connections stuck in `idle in transaction` state under user `dbuser`. The logs show this pattern started immediately at pod startup:

```
09:34:16 INFO Open db connection
09:34:16 ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
09:34:26 INFO Open db connection
09:34:26 ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
...repeating every 10s...
```

After ~2 minutes, the 16 leaked connections filled the pool, and the errors shifted to connection-refused:
```
09:36:36 ERROR Failed to process pending reports: connection to server at "postgres" ... FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved
```

**3. Impact on `payments-api` (namespace: `payments`)**

The `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` pod connects to the same PostgreSQL instance. With all slots consumed, **100% of payment transactions fail** with HTTP 503:
```
ERROR Payment failed tx=722302: connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local" ... FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved
```

**4. Firing alerts confirm the cascade:**
- 🔴 **PaymentErrorRateHigh** (critical) — 100% error rate in `payments`
- 🟡 **PostgresqlTooManyConnections** (critical) — 19 active connections in `shared-services`
- 🟡 **PostgresqlConnectionsHigh** (warning) — same root cause

**5. Additional issue: `reconciliation-service` is CrashLooping (namespace: `shared-services`)**

This is a **separate misconfiguration** — the deployment uses a generic `httpd` image (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`) instead of an application image, and its liveness/readiness probes target port `8443` using `HTTP` scheme (not HTTPS), causing `400 Bad Request` responses → liveness failure → restart loop (7 restarts). This is unrelated to the connection exhaustion but means the reconciliation service is also down.

---

### Fix / Mitigation

**Immediate — Terminate leaked connections (reversible):**

Exec into the postgres pod and kill idle-in-transaction sessions:

```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'idle in transaction' AND usename = 'dbuser';
```

This will immediately free connection slots and restore payment processing.

**Short-term — Fix the `reporting-service` bug (reversible):**

The `v1.0.2` image introduced a `division by zero` bug that causes transactions to fail without proper cleanup. Roll back to `v1.0.1`:

```bash
oc set image deployment/reporting-service reporting-service=quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.1 -n shared-services
```

**Long-term — Increase resilience:**
1. **Increase `max_connections`** on PostgreSQL (currently only 20 — very low for a shared database serving multiple services).
2. **Add connection pooling** (e.g., PgBouncer) in front of PostgreSQL to prevent any single service from exhausting the pool.
3. **Set `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`** on PostgreSQL to automatically kill leaked connections (e.g., `SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '60s'`).

**Fix `reconciliation-service` (separate issue):**
- Replace the `httpd` image with the correct application image.
- Fix the probe configuration: either change the scheme to `HTTPS` for port 8443, or target port 8080 with `HTTP`.

I'll investigate the payment service issue by gathering information from multiple angles simultaneously.I can see critical alerts firing. Key findings so far:
- **PaymentErrorRateHigh** (critical): 100% error rate in `payments` namespace
- **PostgresqlTooManyConnections** (critical) and **PostgresqlConnectionsHigh** (warning) in `shared-services`
- **SharedServicesPodCrashLooping**: `reconciliation-service` pod crash looping in `shared-services`

The payment pod is Running (1/1), so the issue is likely in its dependencies. Let me dig deeper into the pod logs, the shared-services namespace, and check for related metrics.The root cause is clear from the logs. Let me now investigate the PostgreSQL database and the crash-looping reconciliation service to understand the connection exhaustion.Now let me check the PostgreSQL connection metrics and max_connections setting to quantify the problem.Now I have the complete picture. Let me check the reporting-service's connection leak pattern more closely.Here is the complete diagnosis:

---

## Root Cause: PostgreSQL Connection Exhaustion in `shared-services` Namespace

The payment service is experiencing a **100% failure rate** because its dependency — the PostgreSQL database in the `shared-services` namespace — has **run out of available connections**.

### Evidence Chain

#### 1. Payment Service (`payments` namespace)
- **Pod**: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` — Running 1/1, no restarts
- **Error**: Every payment request returns HTTP 503 with:
  ```
  FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
  ```
- The pod itself is healthy; it simply cannot connect to the database at `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432`.

#### 2. PostgreSQL Database (`shared-services` namespace)
- **Pod**: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` — Running 2/2 (postgres + exporter)
- **`max_connections` = 20**, **`superuser_reserved_connections` = 3** → only **17 usable slots** for regular users
- **Current connections on `demo` database: 18 total**
  - **16 connections in `idle in transaction` state** held by user **`dbuser`** — these are **leaked connections** that were never committed/rolled back
  - **2 active connections** from user `demo` (the payments-api user)
- All 17 non-superuser slots are consumed, so new connections are rejected.

#### 3. Connection Leak Source: `reporting-service` (v1.0.2)
- **Pod**: `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` — Running 1/1
- Logs show it opens a new DB connection **every 10 seconds** and hits a `division by zero` error, but **never closes/commits the transaction**, leaving connections stuck in `idle in transaction`:
  ```
  INFO Open db connection
  ERROR Failed to process pending reports: division by zero
  ```
- The reporting-service was recently **updated from v1.0.1 to v1.0.2** (deployment revision 2), which introduced this bug. The old ReplicaSet `reporting-service-76d5ddbcf6` (v1.0.1) was scaled down at 09:34:17.

#### 4. Additional Issue: `reconciliation-service` (CrashLoopBackOff)
- **Pod**: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` — CrashLoopBackOff (7 restarts)
- Uses the **wrong container image**: `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` (a generic Apache HTTPD image, not a reconciliation service)
- Liveness/readiness probes target port 8443 via HTTP (not HTTPS), but the HTTPD container serves HTTPS on 8443, returning HTTP 400
- This is a separate misconfiguration, not the cause of the connection exhaustion

---

### Summary of Issues

| # | Issue | Namespace | Severity | Impact |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **reporting-service v1.0.2 connection leak** — opens DB connections that are never closed after `division by zero` errors | `shared-services` | **Critical** | Root cause of payment failures |
| 2 | **PostgreSQL `max_connections=20` too low** — easily exhausted | `shared-services` | High | Amplifies the leak impact |
| 3 | **reconciliation-service wrong image** — uses `httpd-24` instead of actual service image | `shared-services` | Warning | Service non-functional, CrashLoopBackOff |

---

### Recommended Fix

**Immediate (restore payment processing):**

1. **Roll back `reporting-service` to v1.0.1** to stop the connection leak:
   ```bash
   oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
   ```
   This is **reversible** — you can roll forward again after the bug is fixed.

2. **Terminate leaked connections** — restart the postgres pod or exec into it to kill idle-in-transaction sessions:
   ```sql
   SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity 
   WHERE state = 'idle in transaction' AND usename = 'dbuser';
   ```

**Follow-up:**

3. **Increase `max_connections`** on the PostgreSQL deployment (e.g., to 100+) to provide more headroom. This requires a PostgreSQL restart.

4. **Fix the `reconciliation-service` deployment** — update the container image from `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` to the correct reconciliation service image, and fix the probe configuration (port/scheme).

5. **Fix the `division by zero` bug** in reporting-service v1.0.2 before redeploying, and ensure proper connection cleanup in error handling paths.

I'll investigate the payment service issue by gathering information from multiple angles simultaneously.I can see critical alerts firing. Let me dig deeper into the payment service logs and investigate the dependencies in the `shared-services` namespace, which has related alerts.The picture is becoming clear. Let me now check the PostgreSQL pod logs and the crash-looping reconciliation service to understand the connection exhaustion.Now let me check the PostgreSQL connection settings and the reporting service's connection leak behavior.Now I have the complete picture. Let me visualize the connection leak over time.## Root Cause Analysis

The payment service is experiencing a **100% error rate** (every request returns HTTP 503) due to a **PostgreSQL connection exhaustion** caused by a **connection leak in the `reporting-service`** in the `shared-services` namespace.

### Causality Chain

**1. Root Cause — `reporting-service` connection leak (`shared-services` namespace)**

The `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` (image `v1.0.2`, recently rolled out from `v1.0.1`) opens a new database connection every 10 seconds but **never closes them**. Each iteration logs `Open db connection` followed by `Failed to process pending reports: division by zero` — the application error causes the processing to fail, but the connection remains open in an `idle in transaction` state.

- **Evidence**: `pg_stat_activity_count` shows **16 connections in `idle in transaction` state** from user `dbuser` on the `demo` database — these are leaked connections from the reporting service.
- The `division by zero` error in the reporting service is an application bug introduced in `v1.0.2`.

**2. PostgreSQL connection pool exhausted (`shared-services` namespace)**

- `max_connections` = **20**
- `superuser_reserved_connections` = **3**
- Usable connections for regular users = **17**
- Current backends on `demo` database = **18** (16 leaked `idle in transaction` + 2 active)
- All non-superuser slots are consumed, so PostgreSQL rejects every new connection with: `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

**3. Payment service failures (`payments` namespace)**

- Pod `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` connects to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432` (database `demo`).
- Every payment transaction fails because it cannot obtain a database connection.
- All requests return **HTTP 503**, triggering the `PaymentErrorRateHigh` critical alert (100% error rate).

**4. Secondary issue — `reconciliation-service` CrashLoopBackOff (`shared-services` namespace)**

- Pod `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` is using the wrong container image: `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` (a generic Apache HTTPD image, not a reconciliation service).
- Its liveness/readiness probes target port `8443` with HTTP scheme, but the HTTPD container listens on HTTPS at that port, causing **HTTP 400 responses** → probe failures → container killed → CrashLoopBackOff (7 restarts).
- This is a separate deployment misconfiguration, not directly causing the payment outage.

### Fix / Mitigation

**Immediate — Restore payment service (reversible):**

1. **Kill the leaked connections** by restarting the `reporting-service` deployment to release the 16 idle-in-transaction connections:
   ```
   oc rollout restart deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
   ```
   However, this will only temporarily fix the issue since `v1.0.2` will leak connections again.

2. **Roll back `reporting-service` to `v1.0.1`** (the previous working version) to stop the connection leak and the `division by zero` bug:
   ```
   oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
   ```

**Longer-term improvements:**

3. **Increase `max_connections`** on the PostgreSQL instance (e.g., to 100+) to provide more headroom. The current limit of 20 is very low for a shared database serving multiple services.

4. **Fix the `reconciliation-service` deployment** — update it to use the correct container image instead of `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`, and fix the probe configuration (either use HTTPS scheme for port 8443, or probe the correct application port).

5. **Add connection pooling** (e.g., PgBouncer) in front of PostgreSQL to prevent any single service from exhausting the connection pool.

Let me visualize the connection exhaustion over time.## Diagnosis: Payment Service Outage

### Root Cause

**PostgreSQL connection exhaustion** caused by the `reporting-service` in the `shared-services` namespace leaking database connections. This is preventing the `payments-api` from connecting to the database, resulting in a **100% payment error rate**.

---

### Evidence Chain

#### 1. Payment Service (namespace: `payments`)
- **Pod**: `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` — Running (1/1), no restarts
- **Alert**: `PaymentErrorRateHigh` (critical) — 100% error rate
- **Logs**: Every payment request fails with:
  > `connection to server at "postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local", port 5432 failed: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`
- All requests return **HTTP 503**

#### 2. PostgreSQL Database (namespace: `shared-services`)
- **Pod**: `postgres-5bd4d575fb-872kz` — Running (2/2)
- **`max_connections` = 20**, **`superuser_reserved_connections` = 3** → only **17 usable slots** for regular users
- **Current connections to `demo` database: 18 backends**
  - **16 connections** in `idle in transaction` state held by user `dbuser`
  - **1 active** connection from user `demo`
  - The 17 non-superuser slots are fully consumed
- **Alerts**: `PostgresqlTooManyConnections` (critical), `PostgresqlConnectionsHigh` (warning)

#### 3. Reporting Service — Connection Leak Source (namespace: `shared-services`)
- **Pod**: `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` — Running (1/1)
- **Image**: `quay.io/afalossi/ts01-reporting-service:v1.0.2` (recently rolled from v1.0.1 → v1.0.2)
- **Logs**: Opens a new DB connection every **10 seconds** (`"Open db connection"`) but encounters `division by zero` errors and **never closes the connection**, leaving them `idle in transaction`
- This is the source of the **16 leaked `idle in transaction` connections** from user `dbuser`

#### 4. Reconciliation Service — Secondary Issue (namespace: `shared-services`)
- **Pod**: `reconciliation-service-587768b96f-vn88q` — **CrashLoopBackOff** (7 restarts)
- **Image**: `registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` — this is a generic Apache HTTPD image, **not an application image**. It appears to be misconfigured.
- **Cause**: Liveness/readiness probes send HTTP GET to port `8443` using scheme `HTTP`, but the HTTPD container serves HTTPS on port 8443, returning **HTTP 400**. The liveness probe fails and the container is killed repeatedly.

---

### Recommended Fixes

#### Fix 1: Terminate leaked connections (immediate mitigation — reversible)
Restart the `reporting-service` pod to release the 16 leaked connections:
```
oc delete pod reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb -n shared-services
```
> ⚠️ This is temporary — the new pod will start leaking connections again within minutes due to the bug in v1.0.2.

#### Fix 2: Roll back reporting-service to v1.0.1 (recommended — reversible)
The connection leak started with the v1.0.2 image (the `division by zero` error suggests a bug introduced in this version). Roll back:
```
oc rollout undo deployment/reporting-service -n shared-services
```

#### Fix 3: Increase PostgreSQL `max_connections` (short-term — reversible)
The current limit of 20 is very low. Increase it to provide more headroom:
```
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 100;
```
Then restart the PostgreSQL pod. This buys time but does not fix the leak.

#### Fix 4: Fix the reconciliation-service deployment (separate issue)
The deployment uses the wrong container image (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`) and has misconfigured probes (HTTP scheme on an HTTPS port). Update the deployment with the correct application image and fix the probe configuration (either use `scheme: HTTPS` or point to the correct HTTP port).

The payment service is experiencing a **100% error rate** (all requests returning HTTP 503) due to a **PostgreSQL connection exhaustion** caused by a **connection leak in the reporting-service**.

---

### Causality Chain

#### 1. Root Cause: `reporting-service` connection leak (namespace: `shared-services`)

The `reporting-service-6d7f67656f-nrxcb` (image `v1.0.2`, recently rolled out from `v1.0.1`) has a **bug** — it opens a new database connection every 10 seconds (`"Open db connection"`) but **never closes them**. Each iteration also fails with `division by zero`, meaning the connections are left in an **"idle in transaction"** state.

**Evidence from metrics:**
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| `pg_settings_max_connections` | **20** |
| `pg_settings_superuser_reserved_connections` | **3** |
| Available for regular users | **17** |
| Current backends on `demo` database | **18** (1 active + 16 idle in transaction + 1 exporter) |
| Connections in `idle in transaction` state (user `dbuser`) | **16** |

All 17 non-superuser slots are consumed. The remaining 3 slots are reserved for superuser roles only.

#### 2. Direct Impact: `payments-api` cannot connect (namespace: `payments`)

Pod `payments-api-559656657c-jfn89` connects to `postgres.shared-services.svc.cluster.local:5432` (database `demo`). Every payment transaction fails with:
> `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`

All requests return **HTTP 503**. The critical alert `PaymentErrorRateHigh` confirms a 100% error rate.

#### 3. Secondary Issue: `reconciliation-service` is CrashLooping (namespace: `shared-services`)

This pod uses the wrong container image (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest` — a generic Apache HTTPD, not a reconciliation service). Its health probes send HTTP GET to port 8443 using `scheme: HTTP` (not HTTPS), but the HTTPD container listens on 8443 with SSL, returning **HTTP 400**. The liveness probe fails and the container is killed repeatedly (7 restarts, now in CrashLoopBackOff). This is a separate misconfiguration but does not contribute to the connection exhaustion.

---

### Recommended Fixes

**1. Immediate — Kill the leaked connections (reversible):**

Terminate the idle-in-transaction connections from the reporting-service to restore payment processing. Exec into the postgres pod:

```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'idle in transaction' AND usename = 'dbuser';
```

**2. Fix the reporting-service connection leak (reversible — rollback):**

The `reporting-service` was recently rolled out from `v1.0.1` → `v1.0.2`. The new version has both a connection leak and a `division by zero` bug. **Roll back to v1.0.1:**

```
oc -n shared-services rollout undo deployment/reporting-service
```

**3. Increase `max_connections` as a safety net (reversible):**

The current limit of 20 is very low. Consider increasing it in the PostgreSQL configuration (requires pod restart).

**4. Fix the reconciliation-service deployment (separate issue):**

The deployment uses the wrong image (`registry.redhat.io/rhel9/httpd-24:latest`). It needs to be updated to the correct reconciliation-service image, and the health probe should either target the correct port/scheme or be reconfigured.
